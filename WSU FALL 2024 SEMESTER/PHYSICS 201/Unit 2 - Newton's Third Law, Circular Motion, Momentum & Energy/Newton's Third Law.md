### Action vs. Reaction

- **Newton's Third Law**: for every action there is a reaction (more detail down below)

- Newton's second law is valid only for the forces acting on the object.

$$\overrightarrow{a}_{E} = \frac{\overrightarrow{F}_{ME}}{m_{E}} \hspace{20mm} \overrightarrow{a}_{M} = \frac{\overrightarrow{F}_{EM}}{m_{M}}$$
(E: Earth; M: Moon)

### Propulsion

- **Propulsion**: force that a system with an internal source of energy uses to drive itself forward

> Person - foot pushes the floor which pushes back on you
> Car - tire pushes the pavement which pushes back on the car
> Jet - hot gas is pushed out which pushes back

### Action/Reaction Pairs

> [!example]
> A weight lifter stands up from a squatting position while holding a heavy barbell across his shoulders.
> 
> (three objects: barbell, weight lifter, earth)
> ![[9.16.24 Weightlift FBD]]

> [!example]
> A softball player is throwing a softball.
> 
> (three objects: player, ball, earth)
> ![[9.16.24 Softball FBD]]

> [!example]
> A mountain climber is using a massless rope to pull a bag of supplies up a 45$\degree$ slope.
> 
> (four objects: mountain climber, rope, bag, earth)
> ![[9.16.24 Climber FBD]]

> [!example]
> Block A is heavier than block B and is sliding down the incline (massless ropes and pulley) (Block B is on top of Block A, which is on top of the surface)
> 
> (five objects: block A, block B, rope, pulley, earth))
> ![[9.16.24 Block FBD]]

> [!tip] Newton's Third Law
> Every force occurs as one member of an action/reaction pair of forces.
> 
> - The two members of an action/reaction pair act on different objects.
> - The two members of an action/reaction pair have equal magnitude but opposite directions
> 
> $$\overrightarrow{F}_{AB} = -\overrightarrow{F}_{BA}$$
> (force of A on B is equal to the negative force of B on A)

> [!example]
> ![[9.16.24 Donkey Drawing]]
> 
> Why can the donkey pull the cart?
> 
> The forces act on different objects and there is friction on the donkey.
