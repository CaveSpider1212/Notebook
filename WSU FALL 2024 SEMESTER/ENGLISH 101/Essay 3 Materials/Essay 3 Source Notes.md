## "The what – how – why of English in the workplace: Perspectives from Turkish engineers" by Akif Çal et al.

Text: [[The what   how   why of English in the workplace  perspectives from Turkish engineers.pdf]]

#### Information

^cbebde

The study that this article is conducting wants to explore the current needs of the engineering workplace in Turkey, especially in communication, and provide engineering education programs with data on communication so that they can better prepare engineers. This applies to many different types of engineering in general, and not just civil engineering like in some other sources.

 I think this is a good source because it uses the findings from the study and the data to come to a conclusion. It also involves Turkey, a country that may not be as proficient in English but still have many different types of engineering. This source is a little bit different than the first source as it doesn’t view English as very important in the workplace like the first source does, but the authors believe it is still important for different reasons. This source could both support my argument as well as be kind of a counterargument.

#### Quotes

> *"In this respect, for an engineer to be employable upon graduation, they must possess hard skills such as the formal qualifications obtained through an engineering degree. Additionally, an engineer also needs soft or professional skills such as interpersonal and communicative skills, teamwork and negotiation" (Çal et al. 334).*

This shows that skills in communication ("language") are necessary for any engineer to be successful in their field ("power").

> *"An engineer with good communication skills, especially in English, has increased chances of employment in both in English-speaking and non-English speaking countries" (Çal et al. 335).*

This shows that fluency in English has a higher chance of being employed in an engineering field. One of the ways I defined achieving "power" in engineering is being successful in employment and in the field of engineering, and being fluent in English achieves that.

> *"In research in EFL contexts, however, reading stood out as the most important language skill, as it would enable employees to sustain their profession competency by accessing resource related to their professional life and the workplace, which were available only in English" (Çal et al. 335).*

This shows how exactly English is applicable in engineering workplaces, specifically in foreign countries. This is important as it's typically the people in foreign countries that may not be familiar with the English language.

> *"In general, research on the most important language skill for the workplace has shown varying results, sometimes even within the same country, because communication skills for the workplace are context-dependent" (Çal et al. 335-36).*

This could serve as a potential counterargument as it may be against how exactly I describe English to be crucial to achieving "power" in the field of engineering. However, I can also mention that this still shows English is key to achieving power in engineering even if it's through different aspects of English (reading, writing, speaking, etc.).

> *"In order for engineers to be able to meet the communicative requirements of the workplace, they need high proficiency in general and workplace English, which will help them in job interviews" (Çal et al. 346).*

This once again shows how English ("language") is important in finding success in the workplace for engineering fields ("power").

> *"Therefore, general English proficiency may not be adequate for an engineer's career advancement. Prospective engineers also need competence in relevant workplace communication tasks in English, which will help them with daily tasks and promotion, especially in multinational companies" (Çal et al. 346).*

^67156f

This could also serve as a potential counterargument or naysayer as it shows that being proficient in general English isn't actually enough to be successful in an engineering field, but it does also say that engineers must be competent in workplace communication tasks in English, so it does still indicate an importance of English in the workplace that would help them with "daily tasks and promotion" which would be considered "power."

> *"Secondly, there is a mismatch between what core English courses for engineering programs prioritize and what the workplace needs in terms of specific language skills and tasks. Currently, engineering programs in Turkey place more emphasis on productive skills (i.e. speaking and writing) over receptive skills (i.e. reading and listening). On the contrary, participants reported higher need for receptive skills than productive skills in the workplace" (Çal et al. 346).*

This isn't directly related to what I'm arguing for, but it could still be helpful to demonstrate what the authors of the source were trying to do in conducting the research in this paper and also somewhat shows the role of English in engineering workplaces. This could be somewhat connected to the prompt as the students of those universities that aren't properly taught the right communication skills could be put at a disadvantage.

## "English language needs of Iranian students of civil engineering: Are the courses aligned with workplace needs?" by Nooshin Nateghian

Text: [[English Language Iranian.pdf]]

#### Information

The author wanted to understand the role of English among engineers, particularly civil engineers in Iran. The author used multiple sources of data to understand this, like interviews, classroom observations, field notes, and group discussions. Using this data, the author discovered that in addition to proficiency in English, civil engineers also need to do things like discuss technical issues, attend conferences, read specific genres, and communicate. However, based on the data, the author believes that university programs (specifically those in Iran) aren’t designed according to those specific needs for the students, so the author wants to develop a curriculum for universities that teaches English in a way that meets civil engineering students’ needs.

I think this is a good source because it details the exact role of English in the field of engineering (specifically civil engineering) and why it is important to be proficient in English. This source uses multiple sources of data to support the main argument. This source also applies to the field of engineering as it is about civil engineering, a large engineering field especially in other countries that might not be as proficient in English. This source would help me show the importance of being proficient in English in engineering.

#### Quotes

> *"Most of the company participants highlighted the need to communicate with colleagues globally as a vital need in the workplace. They stated that native-like English language proficiency could decrease the rate of miscommunication that occurs due to linguistic barriers and can unite continents in creativity" (Nateghian 129).*

This quote highlights one of the ways having native English proficiency is important in the engineering workplace. It shows that being fluent in English allows them to be successful internationally in their field, which could be considered "achieving power" the way I defined it.

> *"Four interviewed company members indicated that by international communication they could increase their chances of getting a job around the world, and they felt they could build trust by effective connections. Additionally, they stated that knowing English was helpful for previous employees to get a job in reputable global companies" (Nateghian 129).*

^169721

This quote also indicates that knowing English can increase the chances of engineers for getting jobs. Finding employment and potentially getting promoted are ways engineers can achieve "power," and this is done mainly through "language" (knowing English).

> *"All three groups indicated that English is essential for professionals because most international conferences and congresses are presented in English" (Nateghian 129).*
> 
> *"Overall, both interviews and focus group discussions showed that all three groups were aware of the importance of presentation skills in seminars and conferences. Engineers considered high-quality paper presentation as a means of establishing their credibility" (Nateghian 129).*

^d23835

These quotes show another unique way English is crucial for engineers to achieve "power" in their field. It shows that being fluent in English would allow them to be able to present better, especially as many presentations in engineering are given in English. This in turn would allow them to establish credibility in their field, which is another way they could achieve "power" through "language."

> *"They \[company employees] felt an urgent need to write accurate emails both in terms of lexico-grammatical features and English emailing conventions. One engineer from the company said: \"we have to write approximately 60 email messages per month to other international companies, and poorly written emails can cause our company's reputation to suffer\"" (Nateghian 129).*

This quote indicates how not being fluent in English or at least knowing it could be detrimental to the success of engineers and the company they work for as it could damage their reputation if they don't write accurate emails. This shows another way learning English can lead to being successful in the field of engineering.

> *"The interviewees from the company indicated their most common reading and writing activities that comprised of emails, contracts, project documents, procedure manuals, and reports. The construction manager indicated an urgent need to fulfill students' needs to learn to read authentic documents as it would be required for their future jobs" (Nateghian 130).*
> 
> *"Students also expressed that they were unfamiliar with job-related documents and felt an urgent need to learn about them" (Nateghian 130).*

^f802dc

These quotes show another way learning English is crucial for the engineering field. Many official documents related to the job are written in English, and if the engineers don't truly understand the language it would be harder for them to understand the documents and therefore affect their job performance. This shows that learning English helps engineers be successful in their job (and that not learning it can be detrimental).

## "Transnational Technical Communication: English as a Business Lingua Franca in Engineering Workplaces" by Amy Hodges and Leslie Seawright

Text: [[Business Lingua Franca.pdf]]

#### Information

The authors wanted to find the role of English as a “business lingua franca” (BELF) in the workplace, particularly in engineering workplaces. To do this, they did a study examining the experiences of 10 engineers that graduated from a university in the Arabian Gulf. When using BELF, business professions have a diverse set of language practices based on personal and professional experiences, and those practices constantly evolve according to new situations and interactions. BELF involves more collaboration and responsiveness, as well as responsive explanations to seek clarity in communication. In some countries like Qatar, engineers also adapt their writing and communication for different audiences (much like BELF), which they felt was crucial to their early success on the job. The authors want instructors to provide methods centering intercultural professional communication instead of using English as a standardized language.

 I think this is a good source because it provides another potential way English is used in the engineering workplace, in this case mainly through business. It does also serve as a counterargument in a way as it opposes using standardized English.
 
#### Quotes

> *"Previous research has shown that BELF users employ language strategies that prioritize collaboration and responsiveness, frequent and responsive explanations in order to seek clarity in communication, and multimodal resources such as documents and objects" (Hodges & Seawright 499).*

^6cb943

This quote shows that there are many ways BELF can be used, and this source is about BELF being used in the engineering workplace so the quote could apply to engineering as well.

> *"These Hong Kong workers were less likely to use BELF in spoken discourse but used it for writing, particularly where they perceived that emails might get distributed beyond their original recipient to international partner companies" (Hodges & Seawright 500).*

While it isn't indicated if this is an engineering company they're looking at, it does show ways English can be used to be successful in an engineering career. This source is also about engineering workplaces.

> *"Engineers in the rich linguistic landscape of Qatar told interviewers that their ability to adapt their writing and communication strategies for different and new audiences was crucial to their early success on the job" (Hodges & Seawright 500).*

^1d6349

The ability to adapt their writing and speaking is one of the qualities of BELF mentioned earlier, and this quote directly shows that engineers (particularly in Qatar) do the same thing in the workplace as well. This shows how English, specifically BELF, is used in the workplace and that it is crucial to their success on the job. This shows how "language" (English, or BELF) is used for engineers to achieve "power" (success in the job).

> *"Professional engineers in Qatar use BELF as a tool to communicate because of the multilingual nature of the workforce in this specific location of the world" (Hodges & Seawright 504).*

This shows a reason English is used in the engineering workplace particularly in other countries.

> *"These professional engineers decided which languages to use when writing based on efficiency for both themselves and their users or audience members. They perceived that moving back and forth between languages, in either speaking or writing, was inefficient or potentially confusing for their audience, who used English as a lingua franca for business purposes" (Hodges & Seawright 505).*

^9f5d0c

This quote indicates that engineers typically use English because of their audience, as they are more likely to use BELF instead of the engineers' native language. This shows that using English allows for a wider group of audiences to understand engineers whenever they write or speak.

> *"Interviewees identified “technical terms” as one of the key reasons they preferred writing or speaking in BELF, even in communication that would not necessarily reach their users or audience members" (Hodges & Seawright 506).*

^42adb4

Many professional engineers learn technical terms in the field in English, so it would be much easier to communicate these terms in English to them. This is another reason why learning English is important for achieving "power" in engineering as it would allow them to be more successful in their jobs and in academics as whatever it is that they write or speak would be understood by a bigger audience that also knows English, particularly BELF.

> *"Although transnational technical communicators make these language choices for rhetorical, business, and social purposes, our findings align with Kankaanranta and Lu’s (2013) argument that BELF “can have some homogenizing effects on its users’ cultural identities.” The use of BELF even among all Arabic speakers and technical communicators’ resistance to switching back and forth between languages suggests that the engineering professionals were able to inhabit a workplace identity that elided cultural difference" (Hodges & Seawright 507).*

^0e7b09

This quote provides somewhat of a counterargument that it may not be a good thing for the engineers and their cultures themselves if they are just using BELF in the workplace as it diminishes their own cultural identity in a way. However, cultural identity isn't what I define as achieving "power" for engineers through language, so that doesn't exactly show that learning and being fluent in English doesn't allow for engineers to achieve power.

## "Affordances of engineering with English learners" by Christine M. Cunningham et al.

Text: [[Affordances of engineering.pdf]]

#### Information

The authors want to determine how engineering can be used when learning English. While that part isn’t exactly my research question, this source does mention how for some people, English being a second language (and therefore harder to learn) could lead to them leaning towards a more engineering or science-related field. This source also mentions how engineering provides opportunities for those learning English to be successful in the field. This could lead to the possibility that not only is English not exactly necessary for success in the field, finding it harder to learn English might actually be what makes some people more successful in their field. This source proposes 6 affordances of engineering with English learners, which are basically ways that engineering provides opportunities for them to learn English.

I think this is a good source because it provides several examples of students in different situations of learning English, whether it is their native language or if they are learning it, and how it relates to them and engineering or other related fields. This source may also serve as a possible counterargument.

#### Quotes

> *"...engineering education, and engineering as a field, benefit from participation by diverse learners, including ELs; the array of ideas, perspectives, and approaches they contribute strengthen design solutions" (Cunningham et al. 256).*

^33229d

This quote indicates that engineering in general actually benefits from having people that are learning English as they can bring diverse perspectives. This may imply that being fluent in English is not exactly as necessary for engineers to achieve "power" as other sources may say.

> *"While engineering lessons can be designed to promote discourse among students, draw on student knowledge, and foster the use of multiple modes of communication, such disciplinary discourses pose challenges for all students given new technical vocabulary, interlocking definitions, obscure symbols and notational systems, and nominalization" (Cunningham et al. 259).*

^cad865

This quote is essentially saying that students in engineering education programs may find it hard to really understand all of the technical terms and other things there if they are also learning English. This may be evidence that it actually is necessary to be fluent in English to achieve "power" in engineering in a way (unlike the previous quote).

> *"Engineering may offer valuable opportunities for ELs that build on the strengths they bring to the educational settings: knowledge derived from experience in their communities, local know‐how, uses of materials, and other funds of knowledge" (Cunningham et al. 260).*
> 
> *Not a quote, from Table 1: The author mentions that the features of engineering that can engage English learners include: concurrent learning of disciplinary knowledge and language, open-ended problems, multimodal communication, materiality, teamwork, multiple audiences, contextualized settings for design challenges, and learning from failure (Cunningham et. al 261).*

^6dcf09

This quote (plus the information from the table) indicates how engineering may help people that are learning English with opportunities in the field, as many things in the field depend on their diverse knowledge. This somewhat explains why those learning English may gravitate towards engineering, and may also indicate how it isn't as necessary to be fluent in English in engineering to achieve "power" as other sources say.

> *Affordances of engineering with English learners (Table 2):*
> 
> *"Engineering supports language acquisition by providing opportunities for ELs to practice and develop their social and academic language skills as they work in collaborative groups to negotiate design decisions that are meaningful to them."*
> 
> *"Engineering uses multiple modes to communicate including writing, drawing, and gesturing. Multimodal approaches invite ELs to demonstrate their thinking and participate in small group and classroom deliberations."*
> 
> *"Engineering casts failure as an opportunity to learn. This creates an environment that fosters risk‐taking among students. This orientation allows ELs to take risks linguistically and engage more actively with their peers."*
> 
> *"In engineering, there are often multiple solutions given the criteria and constraints of a particular design challenge. The open‐ended nature of engineering problems encourages diverse approaches and solutions. ELs can draw on their experiences as they generate ideas."*
> 
> *"Successful engineering design solutions benefit from diverse perspectives. Engineering encourages students, including ELs, to draw from their life experiences and consider their personal backgrounds as assets when imagining and designing solutions."*
> 
> *"Features of engineering (multiple solutions, learning from failure, materiality, communication using symbols such as a circuit diagram) foster ELs' success and encourage them to become more active members of the learning community during engineering projects. Consequently, they themselves, their teachers, and their peers have an opportunity to see ELs in a new light."*
> 
> *(Cunningham et al. 266)*

These affordances that the authors proposed detail exactly the ways engineering supports English learners.

## "Maximizing disability diversity, language diversity, and productivity: A study in apparel manufacturing" by Ying Zhang et al.

Text: [[Maximizing Diversity and Productivity.pdf]]

#### Information

The authors mainly observe the relationship that different types of diversity, specifically disability and language diversity (which we would be using for this essay), have with team productivity. The authors run a study and develop models to determine the impact that inclusion would have on team productivity. They determined that team productivity may have a negative effect if workplaces focus on both disability and language inclusion. 

This source is a little harder to connect to the research question, especially since it was focused on “apparel manufacturing” and not engineering and that it wasn’t completely about language. However, I still think it may be a decent source because it provides a model that shows the impact that language diversity may have on success in the workplace.

#### Quotes

> *"In addition to disabilities, the inclusion of individuals across languages is another important dimension of sustainable development. Language forms a foundation of communication. A diverse range of languages is an important trait in a multicultural workforce. In environments where individuals need to work with others in teams, language barriers can adversely impact team productivity" (Zhang et al. 3784).*

^bf0735

This quote shows that while language diversity is important for a multicultural workforce, this can create language barriers that can impact team productivity. This can be connected to engineering workplaces, where language barriers there would also create some issues. With English being one of the main lingua franca of engineering, it's important to learn English to be successful in the field.

> *"Simultaneously having high levels of DD and LD in complex settings may result in reduced PD" (Zhang et al. 3798).*

^acfcf2

This quote directly indicates that, based on the results of the study, having a high disability diversity and language diversity can result in lower productivity. This shows that language diversity harms the productivity of a workplace (which can include engineering workplaces) and why it's important to stick to one language (in the case of engineering, English) in order to have a productive workplace. This helps in engineers achieving "power."
