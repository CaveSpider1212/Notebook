#### Free Fall

- **Free fall**: objects falling without air resistance, motion is only due to gravity
  - Objects dropped from the same height hit the ground at the same time with the same speed (Galileo discovered this)
  - Two objects in free fall have the same acceleration, which is directed vertically downward and has a magnitude of 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> at sea level (gravity)

- Acceleration due to gravity: $g = 9.80 m/s^2$
  1. g is not the same as as $a_{free fall}$
  2. g is always positive, but $a_{free fall}$ is negative
     - $a_{free fall} = -g$
    3. Free fall is uniform accelerated motion
	4. "g" is not gravity, but the acceleration due to gravity
	 5. $g = 9.80 m/s^2$ is only on the earth

#### Motion on an Incline Plane

![[8.23.24 Incline Plane Diagram]]

$$\sin\theta = \displaystyle\frac{a_{parallel}}{a_{free fall}} \rightarrow a_{parallel} = \pm g\sin\theta$$
(g is positive if the object is stationary or moving downwards, and negative if moving upwards)

> a) What is $\theta$?
> $v_{f}= v_{i}+a\Delta t$
> $a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t}$
> $a = \frac{1.7 - 0}{2.3} = 0.74 m/s^2$

> $a_{parallel} = \pm g\sin\theta$
> $\theta = \sin^{-1}({\frac{a_{parallel}}{g}})$
> $\theta = \sin^{-1}(\frac{0.74 m/s^2}{9.80 m/s^2})$
> $\theta = 4.3\degree$
