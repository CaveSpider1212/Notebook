- **Free-body diagram**: represent all the [[Forces]] acting on an object

### Drawing a free-body diagram

1. Identify all forces
2. Draw a coordinate system
3. Represent the object as a dot at the origin
4. Draw all of the forces as vectors
5. (*optional*) Draw the net force vector, $\overrightarrow{F}_{net}$
	- *Same direction as the direction of acceleration*

> [!example]
> Your car is sitting in the parking lot.

> [!example]
> An ice hockey puck glides across frictionless ice.

> [!example]
> An elevator, hanging from a cable, descends at a steady speed.

> [!example]
> Your physics textbook sliding across the table.

> A rocket is being launched straight up. Air resistance is not negligible.

> [!info] Angles in a Tilted Diagram
> The angle between the weight vector and the negative y-axis part is equal to the angle of the slope.

> [!example]
> A skier is going down a 20$\degree$ slope. A horizontal headwind is blowing in the skier's face. Friction is small, but not zero.

> [!example]
> A Styrofoam ball has just been shot straight up. Air resistance is not negligible.

> ![[9.6.24 FBD 9]]

> [!example]
> A spring-loaded gun shoots a plastic ball. The ball is starting to move down the horizontal barrel.

### Solving problems using free-body diagrams and Newton's Second Law

> [!example]
> What is the tension in ropes 1 and 2? Assume the ropes are massless.

> Apply Newton's Second Law:
> $\overrightarrow{F}_{net} = \sum\overrightarrow{F} = m\overrightarrow{a}$
> 
> Use components
> $(F_{net})_x = \sum F_x = ma_x$
> $(F_{net})_y = \sum F_y = ma_y$
> 
> x-component:
> $\sum F_x = ma_x$
> $F_x - T_1 = ma_x$
> $F\cos\theta - T_1 = 0$
> $T_1 = F\cos\theta$
> $\hspace{6mm} = (100$ N$)\cos{30\degree}$
> $\hspace{6mm} = 86.6$ N
> 
> y-component:
> $\sum F_y = ma_y$
> $T_2 - F_y = ma_y$
> $T_2 - F\sin\theta = 0$
> $T_2 = F\sin\theta$
> $\hspace{6mm} = (100$ N$)\sin{30\degree}$
> $\hspace{6mm} = 50.0$ N
