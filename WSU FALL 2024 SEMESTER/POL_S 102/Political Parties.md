### Defining a Political Party

- Group of (somewhat) like-minded individuals who want to attain formal political power in office
	- Distinguish to informal power: e.g. a social movement, protest group
	- Also distinguished from interest groups
- Therefore, political parties are a form of professionalization:
	- Turn citizens into political elites who know the ins-and-outs of policy proposals, policy making, and so on
- Provide links between rulers and the ruled: the political elites and citizens
- Invaluable for healthy democracies

- Ambitious political candidates would have no incentive to build a large scale organization that would be a benefit to so many other candidates

### The Importance of Political Parties

- Organizing people and ideas
- Driver of political participation
	- European context - party membership usually much higher
- A big say in determining the policy agenda
- In the European context, even small parties can have a big impact
	- The "permissiveness" of electoral systems in most European countries
	- Proportional representation

### Themes for Consideration

- What drives formation and success of political parties?
- Two approaches:
	- Bottom-up: social cleavages, changes/dynamic within citizens and the electorate
	- Top-down:
		- Party strategy party elites shaping success, selling their party to the masses, strategically altering party positions and platform to gain favor (and ultimately, votes)
		- Institutions (electoral institutions and laws primarily)
			- Incentives differ from electoral system to electoral system
				- Can new parties break through? Or work within current system?
- Variation in organization of parties and party systems:
	- Coalition-building
		- Multiparty systems: parties will probably have to make compromises
		- Two-party systems: debate/"coalition building" goes on BEFORE running for office (like primaries)
			- This can actually weaken parties because of direct appeals from one person to the electorate

### Key Question in Broader Context of Political Institutions

Do institutions or social cleavages matter more for political party formation and success?

- Contrast to theories of political culture and political economy
- Bottom-up view: not quite culture, but linked
- Top-down view: parties strategically alter outcomes

### Defining "Party System"

- Most common:
	- Two-party systems
		- Only two parties have a realistic chance
		- US as a classic example
		- Also UK, but some variation here
		- Again, tightly linked to the type of electoral system: majoritarian/plurality focused
	- Multiparty systems
		- Multiple parties have a realistic chance of holding power
		- Most democracies have multiparty systems
		- Coalition building
- Less common but still important:
	- Non-partisan system
		- Found in small islands like Micronesia and Tuvalu
		- Absence of political parties
		- Unicameral legislature of Nebraska is non-partisan
	- Single-party system
		- Only one party allowed to hold power, so it's authoritarian
		- Found in countries like China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam
	- One party dominant system
		- In theory, multiple parties exist but only one has realistic chance of power
		- Again, common in authoritarian regimes
		- But also, Japan and Liberal Party from 1955 to 1993

### Effective Number of Parties

> [!info] Effective Number of Parties Formula
> 
> Effective number of parties = $\displaystyle\frac{1}{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2+v_4^2}$
> (v: percentage of votes or seats for the party)
> 
> Used for effective number of parties in elections and in legislation.

### Institutions: Duverger's Law

- Single-ballot majoritarian --> two-party
	- Small parties disincentivized from formation (difficult to win seats)
		- And voters don't want to throw away their votes for party that has no real chance
	- So rally around one of the top two who is most likely to win
- Contrast to proportional systems --> multiparty
	- Small parties have small threshold to win seats
	- Citizens can vote less strategically and more "with their hearts"
- AND majoritarian with run-off systems --> multiparty

### Social Cleavages Theory

> [!tip] Social Cleavages
> Huge societal changes --> shift in social divisions --> collective identities form --> organizations form --> political parties emerge --> party system "freezes"

### Four Main Cleavages in Europe

##### Impact of the development of the nation state

- State vs. church (religiosity)
	- Mostly evident in Christian Democrat parties
	- But a key issue for other parties that might now have "Christian" in their name
- Center vs. periphery (territorial)
	- Some states better than others at assimilating other cultures into the majority nation
	- Tensions between elites in central administrative areas and those in more outlying areas
	- Usually expressed in terms of regional nationalism

##### Impact of the Industrial Revolution

- Owner vs. worker (class)
	- Left and the right
	- Mostly economical conflict
- Land vs. industry (urban/rural)
	- Tension between industrial and agricultural sectors on trade policies such as continued state exercise of control over tariffs
	- Some agrarian/peasant parties, like the Finnish Centre Party and the Polish Peasants People's Party

### More on the Class Cleavage

- Industrial revolution
	- Workers vs. capitalist
	- Proletariat vs. property-owning bourgeoisie
	- Also peasants. vs large landowners
- Redistribution (centralized economy) vs. free market and smaller state
- This is foundation of left-right divide across many countries today

### Post-material Cleavage

What was the "silent revolution"?

Post-WW2:
- High levels of existential security --> intergenerational value shift
- Erosion of materialist values
- Rise of post-materialist values prioritizing individual free choice and self-expression

Eventually expressed in political outcomes

### What are "Materialist Values"?

Meeting basic needs, such as
- Security
- Sustenance
- Shelter
	- For a long time, it was hard to meet needs

### What are "Post-materialist" Values?

- Freedom of speech
- Gender equality, race, LGBTQ+
- Environmentalism
- Citizen input and political participation
- "Individual improvement"

Generational effect: those born under more economic scarcity place a high value on meeting material needs and safety needs

Those born after, are more likely to value post-materialist values

### College Education and Urbanization

- Education effects:
	- More exposure to different backgrounds, cultures, etc.
	- May speak more languages, take new classes
	- Also, more women in education compared to immediately post-WW2
	- Therefore, there is higher "tolerance"
- Urbanization effects:
	- Situated in cosmopolitan centers, many different cultures, race, ethnicity, etc.
	- Combined with "success" of cities (better employment opportunities, higher salaries, cultural events, museums, etc.)
	- Embracing multiculturalism, socially liberal values

##### In contrast...

"Insecurity encourages an authoritarian xenophobic reaction in which people close ranks behind strong leaders, with strong in-group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and rigid conformity to group norms." (Inglehart & Norman)

### Effects of Post-material Cleavage on Politics?

Inglehart and Norman's argument: Older cohorts more likely to vote for authoritarian, populist movements/parties/leaders

On the other hand, younger generations more likely to vote for status quo politicians

### Duverger's Theory

> [!tip] Duverger's Theory
> - Politicized social cleavages, with strategic effect of electoral laws, lead to electoral parties
> - Electoral parties, with the mechanical effect of electoral laws, lead to legislative parties
