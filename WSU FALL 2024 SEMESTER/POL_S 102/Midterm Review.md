## Political Culture

- Consist of norms, values, beliefs, religion, etc. (essentially how people feel about the government) can be a cause of political outcomes, and there is a "congruence" between some features of cultures and politics
- **Civic culture**: attitudes about people working together in the city or government and that they can influence political decisions
	- Also consists of satisfaction with the government and their own life, as well as interpersonal trust
	- Stronger civic culture typically leads to a stronger democracy
	- Decline of social networks has led to a worse civic culture, which has negative consequences for democracy (according to Putnam, in the US in particular, "Bowling Alone")
- Economics also have an influence on civic culture (according to Inglehart, "Values and Democratic Stability"?)
	- Economic change leads to cultural change, leading to a stable democracy
	- Industrialization leads to a shift to secular and rational values, leading to a civic culture (good for democracy)
	- Issue is that he only focuses on industrial countries in his studies
- According to Weber and Fish, religion also plays a role in democracy
	- Protestantism emphasizes individual responsibility, so they are more likely to have a stronger civic culture and democracy than Catholicism, which emphasizes hierarchy (according to Weber, "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism")
	- Islam also often involves female subordination and unquestioned leadership of men, leading to a culture of domination and intolerance and also leading to authoritarianism in their governments (according to Fish, "Islam and Democracy")

## Political Institutions

- **Political institutions**: designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes
	- There are examples of institutions that don't work as intended for each one that does
	- Sometimes when institutions work, it's due to them reflecting the underlying balance of power
	- Institutions may reflect strategic decisions by powerful actors
- Consist of electoral systems, presidential vs. parliamentary systems, and political parties (at least in this class)

### Electoral Systems

- One of the main indicators of a democracy (some authoritarian regimes have elections, but they are usually rigged)
- **Electoral system**: system of rules outlining how elections will be conducted
	- Types: majoritarian, proportional, mixed
	- Lots of variation in the world
- Key concepts of electoral systems
	- **Accountability**: holding politicians and governments accountable (such as how to punish or reward them in the next election)
	- **Representation**: fairly representing a wide variety of people and opinions
- **Majoritarian Electoral Systems**: whoever receives the most votes wins (consist of majority (part wins a majority of the votes) or plurality (largest part wins the majority of the seats) systems)
	- Single-Member Districts (SMDs)
		- Plurality
		- Found in the US, UK, Canada, etc.
		- Simple (one representative accountable to the district, also one candidate per party)
		- Could lead to unrepresentative outcomes
	- Single Nontransferable Vote (SNTV)
		- Plurality, similar to SMDs
		- Multiple candidates in a district (for example, if there are 3 seats, the top 3 are elected)
		- More representative, and still maintains some accountability
		- Can encourage intraparty fighting (possibly multiple people from the same party competing against each other)
	- Alternative Vote (AV)
		- Majority system
		- Rank candidates by order of preference, and if no candidate wins the majority (50%), the bottom candidate is eliminated, and their respective voters' 2nd choices are reallocated, continuing until there's a winner
		- Only one candidate per district, and voters can express several preferences and have a higher chance of having a second choice candidate win if their first choice doesn't
		- Very complicated
	- Runoff Two-Round System
		- Very common system
		- First round of voting, then the top 2 candidates go to a second round
		- First round has a lot of parties, so more options for citizens
		- Very expensive, and citizens may still be forced to vote for an undesirable candidate in the second round
- **Proportional Electoral Systems**: party gets the exact percentage of seats as the percentage of votes they receive
	- Better representation
	- There may be small, extremist parties, so government formation or coalition-building can be problematic
	- Quotas: percentage of seats in the house (used to determine who is elected?)
	- District magnitude: how many representatives per district (larger = more proportional)
	- Electoral thresholds: minimum percentage of votes that must be won to get a seat (discourages smaller, extremist parties and party system fragmentation)

### Presidential & Parliamentary Systems

- Parliamentary regimes often argued to be more likely to survive, and are also more likely to have legislative majorities
- **Presidential systems**
	- Common in the Americas
	- Separation of powers
	- Mutual independence of executive and legislature (elected separately)
	- No quick solutions to moments of political crisis
	- Chief executive can dissolve legislature and call for new elections
	- Said to be more unstable than parliamentary systems (according to Juan Linz, "Perils of Presidentialism")
		- Presidents elected through "zero-sum" elections with potential for conflict
		- President has a very clearly partisan opinion, doesn't necessarily represent everyone's opinions
		- Both president and legislature could make a claim to legitimacy
		- Harder to remove the president compared to the prime minister
	- Pros: president elected by the people; checks and balances; able to act quickly due to stronger powers; more stable (fixed term)
	- Cons: potential conflict between two power; could be bad if unable to easily remove president; more likely to be a little bit authoritarian due to increased polarization
- **Parliamentary systems**
	- Common in Europe and the Caribbean (also most common democracy in the world...41%)
	- Executive (PM) gets legitimacy from legislature, who selects the PM (mutual dependence)
		- Legislature can also dismiss government/PM through vote of no confidence
	- Chief executive can dissolve legislature
	- Commonly have coalitions, which has multiple parties and want representativeness of a broad variety of opinions
	- Parliamentary regimes said to be more stable than presidential regimes (according to Stepan and Skach)
		- Mutual dependence encourages reconciliation between executive and legislative branches, while mutual independence encourages antagonism that could lead to stalemate
		- Parliamentary regimes have votes of no confidence, so easier to remove PM if needed, and PM can also dissolve parliament if needed
	- Pros: faster/easier to pass legislation; good for countries with divided population; easy to form new parties; less political polarization; coalitions
	- Cons: PM only chosen by legislature, not electorate; coalitions/government could be unstable; lack of term limits

### Political Parties

- **Political parties**: group of like-minded individuals who want to attain political power in office
	- Link between politicians and citizens
	- Needed for healthy democracies
	- Organize people and ideas, and allow for political participation (particularly in Europe, where party membership is much higher)
- Party systems
	- **Two-party systems**: only 2 parties have a realistic chance (like the US)
	- **Multiparty systems**: multiple parties have a chance at holding power (many democracies have this)
	- **Non-partisan systems**: no parties (found in small islands, like Micronesia and Tuvalu)
	- **Single-party system**: only 1 party allowed to hold power; authoritarian (like China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam)
	- **One party dominant system**: multiple parties exist but only one has realistic chance for power; authoritarian
- **Duverger's Law**
	- Single-ballot majoritarian electoral systems often lead to two-party systems, discouraging small parties from forming (since it's harder for them to win seats)
	- Proportional electoral systems lead to multiparty systems as small parties still get seats and have a small threshold of votes to do so
	- Majoritarian with run-off systems also leads to multiparty systems
- **Duverger's Theory**: social cleavages, with strategic effect of electoral laws, lead to electoral parties, while electoral parties, with mechanical effect of electoral laws, lead to legislative parties
- **Social cleavages theory**: Huge societal changes --> shift in social divisions --> collective identities form --> organizations form --> political parties emerge --> party system "freezes"
	- Development of the nation state
		- **State vs. Church**: mainly evident in Christian Democrat policies
		- **Center vs. periphery**: some states better at assimilating other cultures into majority nation; possible tensions between central administrative areas and outlying areas
	- Industrial Revolution
		- **Owner vs. worker**: mainly an economical conflict
			- Or "workers vs. capitalist", "proletariat vs. property-owning bourgeoisie", or "peasants vs. large landowners", all class-related things
			- "Centralized economy vs. free market/smaller state" for economy
		- **Land vs. industry**: tensions between industrial and agricultural sectors
- Materialist and post-materialist
	- Materialist values: meeting basic needs like security, sustenance, and shelter (hard to meet for a long time)
	- Post-materialist values: freedom of speech, equality, environmentalism, political participation, individual improvement
		- Those born during economic scarcity tend to value material needs while those born after value post-materialist values
		- Post-material cleavage: mainly after WW2; higher existential security led to intergenerational value shift (from material to post-material), which was expressed in political outcomes
	- According to Inglehart and Norman, older people are more likely to vote for authoritarian and populist movements, while younger people are more likely to vote for status quo politicians
- Education and urbanization lead to higher "tolerance" as there is exposure to different backgrounds and cultures, so more likely to bring socially liberal values

## Political Economy

- **Classic Modernization Theory**: economic development helps democracy *emerge*
	- Countries with higher income level more likely to be democratic, also more likely to transition to democracy (and may or may not be less likely to have regime transitions)
		- China is a country that goes against this theory
	- Some variants (because the CMT lacks a central causal mechanism): structural changes; natural resources; foreign aid; inequality
	- CMT may not necessarily be true as it's just a theory, and it's actually still in dispute
- **The "Survival Story"**: economic development helps democracy *survive*, but not necessarily *emerge*
	- Transitions to democracy aren't really affected by increases in income, and regime transitions become less likely as countries become richer
- Transitions to dictatorship more likely in low-income countries, while transitions to democracy more likely in high-income countries
- Theories of Political Economy (all from the lecture)
	- All members of society possess some endowment that has economic value
	- All members of society are rational decision makers who have an interest in maximizing economic value
	- Because different individuals have different endowments, each seeks to maximize their endowments, so they potentially come in conflict with each other
	- Rational individuals recognize that control of policies/institutions is crucial to maximizing their endowment value
	- Terms
		- **Endowments**: amount/value of the stuff that a person has under their control
		- **Rational decision-making**: procedure by which a decision is based, not the content or substance of it (deliberate, intentional, and conscious choice between alternatives, choosing the option maximizing status)
			- Prefer one or the other, or be indifferent
			- If there's a third option, must be transitive relationship (ranking them)
		- **Conflict**: uneven endowments across people in economic life (like different groups of people see a different use for a plot of land, for example)
- Major implication: Rational actors will care about who forms the government, what policies they pursue, and what institutions are in place because policies and institutions have distributive conflicts; they have influence over the returns we get on our endowments!
	- If benefits of complying with the rules are higher than the costs of changing the rules, most people will try to comply but maybe they will cheat
	- If it's the other way around, rational actors may try to alter the institutions
- Economic institutions (according to Acemoglu & Robinson)
	- **Inclusive**: pluralistic (distributed power) and centralized (state controls a lot of things in the country)
	- **Extractive**: absolutist (unconstrained power) and decentralized (state has little control over what goes on in the country)
