> Heat is not spontaneously transferred from a colder object to a hotter object.

- **Heat engine**: converts heat into work

Work: $W_{gas} = Q_h - Q_c$

Efficiency of an engine: $e = \frac{W_{gas}}{Q_h} = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h}$

> Stirling Cycle: Imagine a pressure vs. volume graph with 2 isotherms at 0$\degree$C and 200$\degree$C, and 2 other lines at constant volume.
> 
> The work is:
> $W = nRT_h\ln\left({\frac{V_2}{V_1}}\right)+ 0 + nRT_c\ln\left({\frac{V_1}{V_2}}\right) + 0$
> $\hspace{6mm} = nR(T_h - T_c)\ln({\frac{V_2}{V_1}})$
> 
> The heat from the hot reservoir:
> $\Delta E_{th} = W_h + Q_h = nC_v\Delta T$ <--- $\Delta T = 0$ since there is no change in temperature
> $\rightarrow Q_h = -W_h = nRT_h\ln({\frac{V_2}{V_1}})$
> 
> The efficiency is:
> $\epsilon = \frac{W}{Q_h} = \frac{T_h - T_c}{T_h} = \frac{473 - 273}{473} =$ 42% efficiency
