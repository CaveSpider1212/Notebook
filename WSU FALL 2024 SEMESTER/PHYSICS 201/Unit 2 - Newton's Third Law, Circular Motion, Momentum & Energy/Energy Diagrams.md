- **Energy diagram**: plot of energy vs. position

> 
> Kinetic energy is the difference between TE and PE:
> $K = E - u$
> 
> **Turning point**: point where $K = 0$ (no kinetic energy) and the motion reverses direction
> 
> Kinetic energy is never negative, so the motion is always between between turning points.
> 
> **Stable equilibrium**: where the velocity is 0
