> [!info] Ideal Gas Law
> $$PV = nRT$$
> 
> $P$: pressure (atm)
> $V$: volume (L)
> $n$: # of moles (mol)
> $R$: constant ($8.206 \times 10^{-2} \frac{\text{L} \cdot \text{atm}}{\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}}$)
> $T$: temperature (K)
> 
> Boyle's Law = $P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$

> [!tip] Kinetic Molecular Theory
> 1. Particles have negligible size relative to container
> 2. Particles have kinetic energy proportional to temperature
> 3. When particles collide, the collision is elastic

### Mixtures

$P = \frac{nRT}{V}, n_{\text{total}} = n_1 + n_2 + ...$
$P_{\text{total}} = \frac{n_1 RT}{V} + \frac{n_2 RT}{V} + ... = \frac{RT}{V} (n_1 + n_2 + ...)$

Partial pressure: $P_1 = \chi_1 P_{\text{total}}$

### Real Gases

> [!info]
> Volume is no longer negligible in real gases (in particular, when pressure is high).
> 
> $$V = \frac{nRT}{P} + nb$$
> 
> $V$: corrected volume
> $b$: constant

### Attractive Interactions

Particles must overcome attractive interactions (IMFs), so the pressure is lower than predicted by the Ideal Gas Law (meaning particles lose energy).

> [!info]
> $$P = P = \frac{nRT}{V} = a(\frac{n}{V})^2$$
> 
> $P$: corrected pressure
> $a$: constant

> [!info] Vander Walls Equation
> $$[P + a(\frac{n}{v})^2][V - nb] = nRT$$
