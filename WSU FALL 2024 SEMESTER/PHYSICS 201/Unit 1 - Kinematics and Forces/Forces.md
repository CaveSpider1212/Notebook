### What is a force?

1. It is a push or pull on an object.
2. It is a vector.
3. It acts on an object and requires an agent.
4. It can either be a long-range force or a contact force.

> [!info] Because force is a vector, they add using vector addition.
> 
> $$\overrightarrow{F}_{net} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \overrightarrow{F}_i = \overrightarrow{F}_1 + \overrightarrow{F}_2 + ... + \overrightarrow{F}_N$$

### Types of Forces

- **Weight** ($\overrightarrow{w}$): force of gravity

![[9.4.24 Weight Force Drawing]]

- **Spring force** ($\overrightarrow{F}_{sp}$): pull when stretched and push when compressed

![[9.4.24 Spring Force Drawing]]

- **Tension force** ($\overrightarrow{T}$): contact force of ropes, strings, wires, etc.

![[9.4.24 Tension Drawing]]

- **Normal force** ($\overrightarrow{n}$): force exerted by a surface exerted on an object pressing against the surface (always perpendicular to the surface)

![[9.4.24 Normal Force Drawing 1]]

![[9.4.24 Normal Force Drawing 2]]

- **Friction**: resistive force between two objects in contact (always parallel to surface)
	- **Kinetic friction** ($\overrightarrow{f}_{k}$): opposite of the direction of motion/velocity
	- **Static friction** ($\overrightarrow{f}_{s}$): opposite the direction the object would move if no friction was present

- **Drag** ($\overrightarrow{D}$): resistive force of gases and liquids

![[9.4.24 Drag Drawing]]

- **Thrust** ($\overrightarrow{F}_{thrust}$): force due to expelling objects

### Newton's First Law of Motion

> [!tip] Newton's First Law
> 
> An object that is at rest will remain at rest, or an object that is moving will continue to move in a straight line at a constant velocity, if and only if the net force on the object is zero.

- **Static equilibrium**: at rest
- **Dynamic equilibrium**: moving in a straight line at a constant velocity

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

> [!tip] Newton's Second Law
> 
> An object of some mass $m$ subjected to various forces $\overrightarrow{F}_1,\overrightarrow{F}_2,...$ will undergo an acceleration $\overrightarrow{a}$ given by
> 
> $$\overrightarrow{a} = \frac{\overrightarrow{F}_{net}}{m}$$
> 
> where $\overrightarrow{F}_{net} = \overrightarrow{F}_1 + \overrightarrow{F}_2+...$. The acceleration vector $\overrightarrow{a}$ points in the same direction as the net force vector $\overrightarrow{F}_{net}$
