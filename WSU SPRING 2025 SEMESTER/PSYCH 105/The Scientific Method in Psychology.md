### The Scientific Method

##### Steps in the Scientific Method

1. Generate a research question or identify a problem to investigate
2. Attempt to explain the phenomena we wish to study
	- Explain why that event occurs as it does, called a theory
	- We will see if the theory is correct
3. Test the hypothesis
4. Interpret the results and draw conclusions carefully
5. Communicate findings to larger scientific community

##### Three Cardinal Features of Science

- **Observation**: to know about the world around us we must be able to see it firsthand
- **Experimentation**: to be able to make causal statements, we must be able to isolate variables (manipulate one variable and see the effect of doing so on another variable)
- **Measurement**: measure subject before and after the strategy to see if it is working or not

##### Basic or Pure vs. Applied Science

- **Basic/pure science**: concerned with the acquisition of knowledge for the sake of knowledge and nothing else
- **Applied science**: desires to find solutions to real-world problems

### Asking and Seeking Answers to Questions

##### The Literature Review

- **Literature review**: examination of the existing body of published research to see what has been done to date
	- Basically to find out what has been done in the past to answer a question once you form the scientific question
- **Gaps**: what hasn't been done yet in research
	- This is what we want to fill in future research

##### Generating a Theory

- **Theory**: systematic explanation of a phenomena
	- Made with our research question as well as examining what has been done to identify gaps
	- Not all scientists develop theories, as many ask research questions under existing theories (so many scientists could be testing the same theory, and a new one could be proposed if the current one doesn't hold up)

##### Testing our Theory

- **Hypothesis**: specific, testable prediction
	- Needed to know if the theory is correct or not

##### Key Features of Scientific Research

- First, we need to **operationalize** or define all variables to be studied.
- Next, we talk about our **research design**, or the plan of action for how a hypothesis will be tested.
	- Includes the way we will adhere to the strictest ethical standards in our research and the specific research method we will use to test the hypothesis
- **Standardization** involves ensuring participants generally have the same experience when they participate in a research study
- **Replication** is when a research study is repeated in the future and by a different research team to see if similar results are obtained using the same protocol.
- The **variable** is something that varies or changes.
- The **population** is the whole group one wishes to learn something about while the **sample** is the subset of the population that one will study.

### How We Arrive At Answers

##### Research Methods in Psychology

###### Naturalistic and laboratory observation

- **Naturalistic observation**: scientist studies human or animal behavior in their natural environment, which could include the home, school, or a forest
	- Researcher counts, measures, and rates behavior in a systematic way
	- See behavior as it happens, but could take a long time for behavior to occur
	- Researcher may also be detected which could influence the behavior
- **Laboratory observation**: observing people/animals in a laboratory setting
	- Can use sophisticated equipment to record session and examine it later
	- Subjects know experimenter is watching them, so their behavior could become artificial

###### Case studies

- **Case study**: detailed description of one person, or a small group, based on careful observation
	- Arrive at a detailed description of the investigated behavior
	- Findings may be unrepresentative of the larger population (lacks **generalizability**)
	- Subject to researcher bias in terms of what is included in the final narrative and what is left out

###### Surveys/Self-Report data

- **Survey**: questionnaire consisting of at least one scale with some questions used to assess a psychology construct of interest
	- Allow for the collection of large amounts of data quickly, but could be tedious for the participant and **social desirability** (and participant could also answer dishonestly)

###### Correlational research

- Examines the relationship between two variables or two groups of variables
- Numerical measure of the strength of this relationship is derived, called the *correlation coefficient*
	- Can range from -1.00, a perfect inverse relationship, to 0, no relationship, to +1.00, a perfect relationship
- You can correlate anything, but even variables that have no relationship with one another (both an advantage and a disadvantage)

###### Experiments

- **Independent variable (IV)**: manipulated variable
- **Dependent variable (DV)**: measured variable
- **Control group**: does not receive the treatment or is not manipulated
- **Experimental group**: does receive the treatment or manipulation
- **Random assignment**: participants have an equal chance of being placed in the control or experimental group
- **Placebo**: thing that appears exactly like the treatment but doesn't actually do anything (participants won't be able to tell if they are given the actual treatment or not)

###### Multi-method research

- Several of the other methods are used in different stages of the research study.

##### Statistics

- **Statistics**: branch of mathematics that collects, organizes, describes, and interprets numerical data

###### Descriptive statistics

- **Descriptive statistics**: provide a means of summarizing or describing data and presenting the data in a usable form (mainly drawing of data)
	- Makes use of the *central tendency* or the middle or center of a distribution of scores (includes mean, median, and mode)
	- Also could include variance, standard deviation, percentile, range, standard error, and correlation

###### Visual representations of our results

- Graphical depictions can be helpful for interpreting the results at a glance

###### Inferential statistics

- **Inferential statistics**: analysis of two or more sets of numerical data to determine the statistical significance of the results (mainly drawing of conclusions)
	- **Statistical significance**: indicates how confident one can be in drawing conclusions, or inferences, about a population based on findings obtained from a sample
	- Types of inferential statistics: *t-test* (compare means of two groups), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, compare means of three or more groups), *multiple regression* (predict a person's score on one variable from their score on a second)

###### Threats to objectivity

- Be aware of our assumptions, biases, and potential for emotional reasoning before analyzing and interpreting results

###### Interpreting our results

- We need to be careful to draw conclusions carefully using the statistics
- We also need to consider other interpretations, such as that our theory is not correct, or that there is uncertainty, or others.

### Ethics of Research

##### Why are Ethical Guidelines Necessary?

###### Milgram's study on learning...or not

- **Confederate**: person who is part of the study without the participant knowing (if there were two people in a study but only one was a participant, the other is a confederate)

##### Principles of Ethical Research

###### Before partipating

- First, research must obtain **informed consent** or when the person agrees to participate because they are told what will happen to them.
	- Participants given information about any *risks* they face or potential harm that could come to them, as well as *confidentiality* or the person's right to not be identified

###### While participating

- Participants given the *ability to withdraw* or exit the study if any discomfort is experienced

###### After participating

- Participants should be **debriefed** or when the true purpose of the study is revealed, and they are told where to go if they need assistance and how to reach the researcher if they have questions
- Human research must be approved by an **Institutional Review Board** (or IRB)

##### The IRB

- Ethical treatment of humans in research is regulated by an IRB
- **Institutional Review Board** (IRB): group formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects
- IRB has authority to approve, require modifications, or disapprove research

##### The IACUC

- The **Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee** (IACUC) oversees all animal research, and will review the institution's program for the humane care and use of animals, inspect animal facilities, review animal welfare concerns, make recommendations about personnel training, and suspend an activity involving animals

### How Can We Share What We Have Learned?

##### Sharing What We Learned

- Reporting allows other researchers to critique our methodology and address our limitations
- Publishing allows psychology to grow its knowledge base about human behavior
- Can see where gaps still exists
- Can communicate findings at conferences (posters/oral presentations), through APA newsletters, research journals

##### Do We Report Non-Findings or Negative Findings?

- **Positive publication bias**: studies with positive results are more generally represented in literature than those with negative or null findings
- Negative results provide a system of check and balances against similar positive findings and so not publishing them could inflate the efficacy of some treatments or allow false positive to remain unchecked
- Reporting all findings (positive, negative, null) fills in the scientific record and allows us to draw more reliable conclusions

##### Parts of a Research Article

- **Abstract**: summary of the entire article (at the beginning of the article)
	- Describe experiment and allow reader to decide if they want to read it further
	- Statement of purpose, overview of methods, main results, brief statement of conclusion
- **Introduction**: summary of the current literature relating to topic
	- Allows reader to see how you arrived at your hypothesis, and design of study
- **Method**: share information on our design and sample with readers
	- Covers participants, materials, and procedure
- **Results**: state outcome of experiment and whether statistical analyses were significant or not
- **Discussion**: restating main findings and hypothesis of the study, and interpretation of the findings and their significance
	- Also state strengths and limitations of the study

### Issues in Psychological Research

##### Convenience Sampling

- **Convenience sample**: many studies are conducted with college students which leads to an issue with the generalizability of psychological research

##### The Replication Crisis in Psychology

- Published findings in psychology are not replicable

### What makes Psychology scientific?

- <u>Scientific</u> study of behavior and mental processes
- The scientific method
	- Systematic approach to understanding the world around us
	- Starts with curiosity
- **Pseudo-psychology**: appears to be psychology but is not supported by empirical, objective evidence
	- Astrology

### Step 0

- Inquisitive nature
- Critical thinking:
	- Ask questions about the world around us
	- Be willing to wonder and explore
	- Objective judgments based on evidence
		- Not emotions or anecdotes
	- Assess claims made by others critically

(Missing 1/13/25 notes)

### Key Research Concepts

##### Operationalization (operational definitions)
- Defining variables precisely
- Creating measurable definitions
	- Example: what exactly constitutes "unsportsmanlike conduct"

##### Research Design

- Planning the study methodology
- Ensuring ethical standards
- Selecting appropriate methods

##### Standardization

- Ensuring consistent participant experience
- Controlling for external variables
- Maintaining procedural consistency

##### Variables

- Independent variables (IV's) - manipulated
- Dependent variables (DV's) - measured
- Control variables - kept the same

##### Population vs. Sample

- Population: entire group of interest
- Sample: subset we study
- Importance of *representative* sampling

### Research Design: Sample

##### Random Sample

- Subset of the population chosen through a procedure that ensures all members of the population have an equally likely chance of being selected to participate in the study

##### Representative Sample

- Subgroup of a population selected so that its members have characteristics that closely reflect those of the population of interest
- **External validity**

### Practical Implications

##### For Research

- Need for clear operational definitions
- Importance of standardized procedures
- Value of replication studies

##### For Practice

- Evidence-based interventions
- Cultural considerations
- Practical applications

### Five Research Designs in Psychology

##### Observational Research

- Important features
	- Environment not disturbed
	- Often used to study new/unexplored topics
	- High **ecological (external) validity**
		- Findings are easily generalized back to the population
- Pitfalls
	- Unwanted variables environment
	- Replication of research is difficult
- Observer bias
	- Errors due to researcher's value system, expectations, attitudes reduced with comparison from multiple observers

##### Case Studies

- Important features
	- Detailed examination of individual or small group
	- Includes large amount of data on one person
	- In-depth analysis
- Pitfalls
	- Potential researcher bias
	- Sample size (1 person or a few people) is too small to generalize to a larger population

##### Surveys/Self-Report Data

- Advantages
	- Fast
	- Large data collection
	- Standardized format
- Pitfalls
	- Social desirability bias (want to look better)
	- Response accuracy (random answers just to finish survey)
	- Representative sample and survey

##### Correlational Research

- Measures relationships between variables
- Correlations are typically denoted by an "R-value" which can range from -1 to +1
	- Strength of relationship
	- Positive vs. negative correlation
- Advantages:
	- Can study naturally occurring relationships
	- Useful for prediction
- Pitfalls
	- Can't establish causation

###### Significance

- Positive vs. negative correlation
	- Positive = as one variable increases the other variable increases
		- Height and weight
	- Negative: as one variable increases the other variable decreases
- Statistical significance of correlation
	- "p-value" - how likely is it that the relationship is due to chance
	- p = .05 or .01, typically
		- 95% or 99% chance relationship is *not* due to chance

##### Experiments

- Includes the following:
	- IV
	- DV
	- Control groups
	- Random assignment
- Design:
	- Control of all variables other than IV and DV
	- Manipulation of IV
	- Measurements of outcomes
		- Pre, post, and in-between
- Advantages:
	- Shows a cause-and-effect relationship
	- High internal validity
- Pitfalls:
	- Time consuming
	- Low external validity

### Experimental Method: Placebos

- **Placebo**: an inert substance given to control group; a fake treatment that has no benefit, but is administered as if it does
	- Looks real: one of these pills contains an active ingredient; the other is a placebo. In placebo-controlled drug trials, researchers give some participants drugs and others placebos.
		- People taking the placebos often experience effects that are similar to those reported by the participants taking the actual drugs.

### Research Quality Considerations

- Threats to objectivity
	- Researcher bias
	- Assumptions
	- Emotional reasoning
	- Design flaws
- Interpreting results
	- Draw careful conclusions
	- Consider alternate explanations
	- Acknowledge limitations
	- Tolerate uncertainty

### Modern Ethical Guidelines: Before Participating

- Informed consent requirements
	- Clear explanation of procedures
	- Description of potential risks
	- Explanation of benefits
	- Alternative options explained
- Confidentiality guarantees:
	- Protection of identity
	- Data security measures
	- Limits of confidentiality

### Modern Ethical Guidelines: During Participation

- Right to withdrawal
	- Can stop participation at any time
	- No penalties for withdrawal
	- Immediate assistance if needed
- Ongoing monitoring
	- Participant wellbeing
	- Signs of distress
	- Available support

### Modern Ethical Guidelines: After Participation

- Debriefing requirements:
	- True purpose revealed
	- Explanation of any deception
	- Resources for support
- Follow-up procedures:
	- Contact information provided
	- Access to study results
	- Reporting mechanisms
