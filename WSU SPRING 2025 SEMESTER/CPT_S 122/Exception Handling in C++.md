### What is an Exception?

- **Exception**: a *signal* or *event* that denotes a problem has occurred during program execution that requires special processing
	- Should only occur during "exceptional" circumstances

### Exception Handling

- **Exception handling**: a process for detecting and resolving exceptions
- C++ exception handling is built on three keywords
	- `try`
	- `catch`
	- `throw`
- Exception handling processes *synchronous* errors, which occur when a statement in the program executes
	- Does not process *asynchronous* events that may happen independent of program flow

##### `try` Block

- Contains code that might generate an exception

##### `catch` Handler

- Executes as a result of an exception
- The correct handler is "activated" when a match occurs between the type of exception thrown and the type of parameter in the handler
- An exception parameter should always be declared as a reference to the type of exception in the handler

##### Keyword `throw`

- When an unexpected circumstance occurs an exception is generated by the keyword `throw`

### Fault-tolerant Programs

- **Fault-tolerant program**: program that can satisfy most, if not all requirements, even if faults or exceptions occur
- These programs handle faults or exceptions gracefully, which provides a level of robustness
