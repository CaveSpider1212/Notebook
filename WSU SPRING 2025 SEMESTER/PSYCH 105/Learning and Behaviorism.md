### Learning - What is it?

- **Learning**: any relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience and practice
- Key components:
	- Relatively permanent (can be modified with new experiences)
	- Changes in behavior
	- Results of experience/practice with stimuli and consequences

### Types of Learning

- **Associative learning**
	- Classical (respondent) conditioning
	- Operant conditioning
- **Observational learning**
- **Non-associative learning**
	- Habituation - stop responding to stimuli
		- Orienting response: attention returns shortly
	- Sensitization - reactions are increased due to strong experience

### Behaviorism: Historical Context

- **Wave 1: Behaviorism proper**
	- Ivan Pavlov: classical conditioning
	- John B. Watson: respondent conditioning
- **Wave 2: Neo-behaviorism**
	- Thorndike: law of effect
	- B.F. Skinner: operant conditioning
		- Coined the term "operant" to describe behaviors that were initiated by an organism and then responded to by the environment
- **Wave 3: Socio-psychological learning**
	- Albert Bandura: observational learning

#### Behaviorism

##### Key Terms

- **Instinct**: inherent or innate behaviors (more complex)
	- **Reflex**: also an automatic behavior, frequently out of conscious awareness (less complex)
- **Learning**: relatively enduring changes in behavior or knowledge as a result of experience
	- **Associative learning**: fundamental process of learning connections between events and situations
- **Conditioning**: a process of learning associations between stimuli and behavior

##### Classical (Respondent) Conditioning

- Links neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus
- Three phases:
	- Preconditioning
	- Conditioning
	- Postconditioning
- Example: Pavlov's dogs
- **Unconditioned stimulus (UCS)**: natural stimulus that reflexively elicits response without the need for prior learning
- **Unconditioned response (UCR)**: unlearned, reflexive response that is elicited by an unconditioned stimulus
- **Conditioned stimulus (CS)**: formerly neutral stimulus that acquires the capacity to elicit a reflexive response
- **Conditioned response (CR)**: learned, reflexive response to a conditioned stimulus

##### Learning and Unlearning Fears

- Watson's **Little Albert study**
- Jones' counter-conditioning study
- Methods to unlearn fears:
	- Counter-conditioning
	- Flooding

#### Neo-behaviorism

##### Operant Conditioning

- **Stimulus** --> **Response** --> **Consequence**
	- Focus on the consequences of behavior
	- Thorndike's **Law of Effect**
		- Behaviors followed by a <u>satisfying effect</u> are more likely to occur in the future
		- Behaviors followed by <u>undesired effects</u> are less likely to be repeated
- **Operant conditioning**: the consequences of a behavior can either be rewarding or punishing
	- **Reinforcing**: the behavior is more likely to happen in the future
		- **Primary Reinforcer**: anything with innately desirable qualities
			- Examples: food, water, shelter, sex
		- **Secondary Reinforcer**: only has reinforcing qualities due to its link with a primary reinforcer
			- Examples: money, praise, grades
	- **Punishing**: the behavior is less likely to happen in the future
	- That reward or punishment can be in the form of something that was either added to (Positive) or subtracted from (Negative) the environment

##### Skinner's Four Contingencies

- *Adding reinforcement*: adding something desirable to increase behavior
- *Removing reinforcement*: removing something aversive to increase a behavior
- *Adding punishment*: adding something aversive to decrease behavior
- *Removing punishment*: removing something desirable to decrease a behavior

##### Examples

- Spanking a kid = **positive punishment**
- Getting an A on an exam you didn't study for = **positive reinforcement**
- Your instructor pushes back an exam you are very nervous for = **negative reinforcement**
- Students abusing instructors kindness on extensions, instructor decides to not give extensions again = **negative punishment**

##### Behavior Modification

- A core component of <u>nearly all</u> psychological interventions involves modification of behavior
	- This is especially true in work with young children, and ASD/developmental delay
- Which operant contingency do you think is the most effective for changing behavior?
	- Punishment or reinforcement?

##### Issues Using Punishment

- Punishment is most effective if it is consistently applied, whereas reinforcement can be varied
- Punishment can inadvertently teach fear
	- Trauma
- Punishment can accidentally inhibit desired behaviors
- Use of physical punishments can increase violent and aggressive behaviors in children

##### Alternatives to Punishment

1. Reinforce the desired behavior
2. Remove reinforcement of undesired behavior
3. Reinforce a behavior that is incompatible with the undesired behavior

##### Shaping Behavior

1. Reinforce any response that resembles desired behavior.
2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce previously reinforced responses.
3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles desired behavior.
4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of desired behavior.
5. Finally, only reinforce desired behavior.

#### Observational Learning

- **Observational Learning**: learning which occurs through observation and imitation of a model
	- Believed to involve "mirror neurons"
- Allows organisms to acquire behaviors that are difficult to acquire through shaping

##### Latent Learning

- Edward Tolman
	- Cognitive processes, although they cannot be directly observed, play a role in behavior
		- *Cognitive maps*
- **Latent learning**: learning that occurs but is not observable until there is motivation to demonstrate it

###### Increasing the Likelihood of Imitation

- People who are rewarded for their behavior
- Warm, nurturing people
- People who have control over you or have the power to influence your life
- People who are similar to you in terms of age, sex, and interests
- People you perceive as having higher social status
- When the task to be imitated is not extremely easy or difficult
- If you lack confidence in your own abilities in a particular situation
- If the situation is unfamiliar or ambiguous
- If you've been rewarded for imitating the same behavior in the past
