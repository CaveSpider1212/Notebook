**Value proposition**: the primary reason a customer will use our product or service (their benefits)

*Purpose of a value proposition:*
1. Explain how the product/solution solves customers' problems or improves their situation (Relevancy)
2. Define the specific benefits to the customer (Quantified Value)
3. Inform customers why they should buy our product instead of a competitor's

> [!info]
> Be clear and succinct when writing value propositions.
> 
> They should be brief and easy to understand, with no hype words, superlatives, or jargon. Instead, communicate the benefits and uniqueness in a clear way.
> 
> They should also be concise as well.

> [!tip] Winning Value Proposition
> A winning value proposition explains the following:
> - Who the product/service is for
> - What product/service the company is selling
> - Benefits of product/service
> - What makes product/service unique compared to that of competitors

> [!tip] Steps to Creating a Value Proposition
> 1. **Define** the problem to determine whether it's a problem worth solving
> 2. **Evaluate** whether the solution uniquely solves the problem (solves the 3 D's)
> 3. **Measure** how hard it would be for customers to adopt the product/service (ideally we want to maximize the gain given to the customer while reducing the "pain", or cost/effort needed to adopt or learn this product/service)
> 4. **Craft** the value proposition

Fill in this framework for creating a value proposition:
- For (target customers)
- Who are dissatisfied with (the current alternative)
- Our product is a (new product)
- That provides (key problem-solving capability)
- Unlike (alternative)

As the startup creator, we also need to consider these questions:
- What problems do we understand uniquely well?
- What solution can we deliver uniquely well?
- What kind of disruptive business model can we bring to the market based on our insights and capabilities?
