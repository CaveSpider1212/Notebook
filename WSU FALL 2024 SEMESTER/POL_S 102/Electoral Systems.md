### Political Institution Theories

- Overall, posit some congruence between elements of political institutions and other political outcomes
- Institutions are the "rules of the game" that are designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes
- Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behavior and punish violations

- Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social reactions

### Three Big Lessons

1. For every example of institutions that work in the way intended by their designers, there are plenty of other examples that do not work as intended
2. Sometimes when institutions work, it is because they reflect the underlying balance of power
3. Pay attention to the origins of institutions because they may reflect strategic decisions by powerful actors

### Elections and Electoral Laws

- Why so important?
	- Probably THE most or at the very least one of the clearest indicators of a democracy
	- The bare minimum
- Not always true, nuances:
	- Some authoritarian regimes use elections, but these are usually rigged/manipulated in some way
- Electoral system
	- A system of rules that outline how elections will be conducted
	- Main types:
		- Majoritarian
		- Proportional
		- Mixed
	- In reality: great deal of variation

### Two Key Concepts

##### Accountability

- Holding politicians, political parties, and governments accountable
	- How to punish or reward those people at the next election

##### Representation

- To what extent the government/parliament/etc. most fairly and accurately represents a wide variety of people and opinions within a polity

### Majoritarian Electoral Systems

- Seats in legislature allocated by territorially-based districts or constituencies
- Whoever receives the most votes wins
	- **Majority systems**: party wins a majority of the votes
	- **Plurality systems**: largest party wins the majority of the seats even if the party doesn't win a majority of the votes

##### Majoritarian Type #1: Single-Member Districts (SMDs)

- Plurality system (like US, UK, Canada, India, Nigeria)
	- Just need to win the plurality of votes within a system
- Strengths?
	- Simplicity - one representative accountable to the district
- Weakness?
	- Unrepresentative outcomes likely, at local and national level

##### Majoritarian Type #2: Single Nontransferable Vote (SNTV)

- Similar to SMDs, but multiple candidates in a district
	- Example: 3 seats, top 3 are elected
- Strengths?
	- More representative, whilst maintaining some (although not as much) accountability
- Weaknesses?
	- Can encourage intraparty fighting
	- Candidates from the same party standing against one another (as opposed to one candidate per party under SMD)

##### Majoritarian Type #3: Alternative Vote (AV)

- Absolute majority, NOT a plurality
- Rank order candidates (like 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc.)
	- If no candidate wins 50%, the bottom candidate is eliminated, and their respective voters' 2nd choices are reallocated, and continues until there is a winner
- Strengths?
	- Still only one candidate per district, so high accountability
	- Voters can express several preferences, and have a better shot at their second preferred candidate getting in, if the first fails
- Weaknesses?
	- Complicated - requires a great deal of information for voters to know about all of the parties/candidates, beyond their top preferred one

##### Majoritarian Type #4: Runoff Two-Round System

- Most common way of electing presidents around the world
- First round of voting, and the top two candidates go through to a second round
- Strengths?
	- First round tends to have a lot of parties (citizens can express lots of preferences)
- Weaknesses?
	- Might still be forced for vote for an undesirable candidate in the second round
	- Significant costs

### Proportional (PR) Electoral Systems

- The party should get the exact percentage of the seats as the percentage of votes they receive
- Lots of variation
- All of them have multimember districts (unlike majoritarian systems which have single member districts)
	- District size typically differs
- All use some kind of quota/divisor to determine who exactly is elected
- Strengths?
	- More proportional, so it's better for overall representation
- Weaknesses?
	- Small, extremist parties, so government formation or coalition-building can be problematic

##### PR Factors

- Quotas
	- Percentage of seats in the house?
- District magnitude
	- The most important factor influencing the proportionality of a system
	- How many representatives per district?
	- Larger magnitude: more proportional
		- Can even vary within systems
		- The whole country could be one huge district (like the Netherlands with 150 seats, so each candidates need to get 1/150 votes to get a seat)
- Electoral Thresholds
	- A minimum % of votes a party/candidate must win before they can get a seat
	- Discourages smaller, extremist parties and party system fragmentation

### Think About This

- More broadly: institutions vs. culture in determining outcomes?
- For you, is there a perfect mix of accountability/representation?
- Which one is more important to you?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of different systems?

- Institutions have consequences, there is very strategic choice in choosing an institution
	- **Malapportionment**: imbalance in allocating seats to different districts
	- **Gerrymandering**: redefining districts in irregular shapes to benefit a particular party
