### What is Consciousness?

- **Consciousness**: being aware of our own thoughts, feelings, behaviors, sensations, and perceptions
	- Includes both mental activities and what is going on in our environment
- **States of consciousness**: features/characteristics of consciousness at any given moment
	- Include coma, sleep, meditation, hypnosis, being alert, and daydreaming
	- Can shift between these states quickly
- Levels of consciousness
	- **Conscious**: mental activities accessible to awareness occur
	- **Nonconscious**: mental activities NOT accessible to awareness occur
	- **Cognitive unconscious**: contains mental events that are initially not conscious but can become such or can influence conscious experience
		- **Preconscious**: mental events which are not conscious presently
		- **Subconscious**: mental events which are not conscious, cannot become so, but influence consciousness nonetheless
- For Freud, awareness occurs when motives enter *consciousness*, from either the *preconscious* or the *unconscious*, and these are the ways he proposed instincts are satisfied
	- He says that motivation arises when instinctual impulses reach consciousness, creating pressure that drives behavior

### Biological Rhythms

- **Biological rhythms**: regular fluctuation in a biological system that can have psychological ramifications
	- Control processes such as blood pressure, hormone/urine levels, sleep-wake cycle, and hibernation patterns
	- **Endogenous factors**: internal clocks which control these processes
- **Circadian rhythm**: include sleep-wake cycle, core body temperature, heart rate, stomach contractions, breathing, menstrual cycle, blood clotting, alertness, and metabolism
	- Operates on a 24-hour cycle
	- Exists in humans, plants, insects, and animals
	- **Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)**: biological clock located in a cluster of cells in the hypothalamus which control circadian rhythm
- **Infradian rhythm**: affects the brain, metabolism, immune system, microbiome, stress response, and reproduction
	- Regulated by hormonal fluctuations, environmental cues, and genetic factors
	- Recurring, last longer than a day
- **Ultradian rhythm**: affects blood circulation, pulse, heart rate, thermoregulation, blinking, appetite, and arousal
	- Repeated throughout a 24-hour day
	- Shorter period, higher frequency than a circadian rhythm

### Sleep

- **Electroencephalograph (EEG)**: measure brain wave patterns of participants during sleep
	- **Frequency**: speed of the waves
	- **Amplitude**: height of the waves
	- Types of brain waves
		- *Beta Waves*: 12-30 cycles per second; associated with alertness and wakefulness
		- *Alpha Waves*: 8-12 cycles per second; occur only when eyes are closed but the person is mentally alert, and disappear when eyes reopen; associated with relaxation and calmness
		- *Theta Waves*: 4-8 cycles per second; occur when person is asleep; associated with meditation, creativity, and dreaming
		- *Delta Waves*: <4 cycles per second; occur when person is asleep; associated with deep sleep and unconsciousness
- REM (rapid eye movement) and NREM (non-REM) sleep
	- **Stage 1 NREM sleep (N1)**: 
		- Lightest stage of sleep
		- Transition from wakefulness to sleep
		- Lasts a few minutes, and if you are awakened from it you do not realize you were asleep
		- Eye movements are slow and rolling, the heartbeat slows, muscles relax, and breathing slows
		- Brain waves become small and irregular (Theta waves)
	- **Stage 2 NREM sleep (N2)**: 
		- Brain gives off short bursts of fast, high-peaking waves called sleep spindles
		- Body prepares to enter deep sleep
		- Largest percentage of total sleep time
		- No eye movements, body temperature drops, and heartbeat and breathing continue to slow
	- **Stage 3 NREM sleep (N3)**
		- No eye movements
		- Delta waves emitted (low frequency and high amplitude), in addition to the sleep spindles of Stage 2
		- Muscles relax, breathing is slower, pulse slows down, and it is difficult to awake you
		- Body repairs and regenerates tissue, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens the immune system
	- **REM sleep**
		- Eyes move, heart rate increases, dreaming happens, breathings becomes rapid and shallow, blood pressure rises, difficulty regulating body temperature, loss of muscle tone
		- Body is paralyzed to keep the person acting out their dream, and potentially hurting themselves or others
		- Brain activity resembles that of an awake person
		- Occurs about 90 minutes after falling asleep, lasts about 10 minutes the first time and each following cycle gets longer with the final cycle lasting 30-60 minutes
- When we sleep, our bodies use less energy to allow cells to resupply and stock up for the next day, and our brain also reorganizes and catalogs memories and information learned through the day
	- Helps with healing injuries, repairing tissues and muscles, and growing bones
	- Improved mood, healthy heart, regulation of blood sugar, relieving stress and maintaining a healthy weight
- Sleep disorders
	- **Narcolepsy**: excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, sleep paralysis, or the inability to move when falling asleep or waking up, sudden loss in muscle tone (cataplexy), memory problems, and fragmented sleep through the night
		- 1 in 2000 people
	- **Insomnia**: difficulty falling and/or staying asleep
		- Short-term: 15-20% of people
		- Chronic: 10% of people
	- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: person's breathing is interrupted during sleep
	- **Sleepwalking**: person walks around while asleep
	- **Sleep/Night terrors**: episodes of fear, flailing and screaming while asleep

### Dreaming

- **Dreams**: series of images, emotions, sensations, perceptions, and ideas that occur involuntarily in the mind and last seconds to several minutes
	- Mostly during REM sleep (NREM sleep dreams tend to be less memorable)
- Content of dreams
	- **Manifest content**: what we experience during sleep and recall upon waking up
	- **Latent content**: unconscious wishes or fantasies and is what needs to be interpreted, but in the content of the dreamer's waking life
- Carl Jung saw dreams as compensatory in nature or attempting to fix deficiencies in personality, and they help resolve current conflicts and further the development of the individual in a healthy direction
	- He used *amplification* to help dreamers understand their dreams

### Drugs

(Key Takeaways in the textbook)
- An altered state of consciousness is when your mental state changes enough from what is considered normal for you that it becomes noticeable to yourself and others.
- An individual is diagnosed with substance use disorder, substance intoxication, or substance withdrawalÂ specific to the substance or substances being ingested though the symptoms remain generally the same across substances.
- Substance use disorder occurs when a person experiences significant impairment or distress for 12 months due to the use of a substance.
- Substance intoxication occurs when a person has recently ingested a substance leading to significant behavioral and/or psychological changes.
- Substance withdrawal occurs when there is a cessation or reduction of a substance that has been used for a long period of time.
- Depressants include alcohol, sedative-hypnotic drugs, and opioids.
- Stimulants include cocaine and amphetamines, but caffeine as well.
- Hallucinogens come from natural sources and produce powerful changes in sensory perception.
- Cannabis is also derived from a natural plant and produces psychoactive effects.
- Many drugs are taken by users in combination which can have dangerous results depending on the interactions between the substances.

### Hypnosis

- **Hypnosis**: state of consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness characterized by an enhanced capacity for response to suggestion and has three ways to use it
	- Mental imagery
	- Ideas or suggestions can be more easily presented to a hypnotized patient since their attention is focused
	- Technique can be used for unconscious exploration such that the underlying motives driving a person's behavior can be exposed
- Hypnosis is used in medicine, dentistry, and behavioral emdicine
