**Statement**: Anything that is either true or false (but not both)

> [!info] Logical connectives
> - Conjunction ("and"): $\land$
> - Disjunction ("or"): $\lor$
> - Negation ("not"): $\sim$

> [!tip] Rules of Precedence
> 1. $\sim$ has precedence over $\land$ and $\lor$
> 2. $\land$ and $\lor$ have the same precedence. They are NOT performed from left-to-right, so use parentheses to clarify (ex: $x \land (y \lor z)$)
