#### Notes from the reading

- Education is mainly depositing knowledge from the teacher to the student, very similar to banking
- In the banking concept, teachers consider themselves knowledgeable, and they consider students to know nothing, which is how the teacher justifies their existence
  - Students also seem to accept their ignorance and "adapt" to the system, which allows for them to justify the teacher's existence
  - Basically they see each other as contradicting each other, or as polar opposites
  - The subjects, in this case students, are basically considered as only objects that receive information
  - This is almost identical to oppressive societies in real life
- Because students seem to adapt to the system that the teachers force on them in the banking system, it limits their room for creative power, and the teachers also appear to control the thinking of the students in this system
  - The more the "oppressors" (teachers) can get the "oppressed" (students) to adapt to that situation, the more easily they can be dominated (given knowledge)
- Basically, a solution for this is not to "integrate" the oppressed into the structure of oppression (or make them adapt), but to change the structure so that the "oppressed" can become "beings for themselves," which is against the oppressors' purpose
  - To prevent this, oppressors use the banking concept of education
- Sooner or later, the "deposits" that teachers give to the students can lead to them realizing the contradiction that the banking concept of education is trying to maintain them in, and the students will try to liberate themselves from the system
- A solution to the oppressive banking concept is having teachers essentially be partners with the students and have trust in their creative power, but the banking concept of education does not allow for such partnership
- In the banking concept, the education provided essentially makes students gullible to believe that and make them adapt to the oppressive system
- The problem with liberation is that those who are involved in liberation are surrounded and influenced by the environment that creates the banking concept, and often don't see its significance or power in dehumanizing its subjects or patients, so they use the same method of alienation in trying to liberate from the banking concept
  - Those that want to liberate from the banking concept must reject the banking concept in its entirety, and instead have a concept of people as conscious beings
  - They can do this by problem-posing education, which breaks the vertical system of banking education, but this is only done by overcoming the contradiction between teachers and students, which is replacing the "teacher-of-the-students" and "students-of-the-teacher" ideas with "teacher-student" and "student-teacher," where the teacher and students teach each other through dialogue
    - Problem-posing education actually allows students to think critically about the world they live in rather than being gullible and just receiving knowledge from a teacher in banking education
- The banking method consists of a "cognitive" phase where the teacher knows something that can be known or identified while preparing their lesson, and a "narrative" phase where they narrate that identifiable object to the students, and have them memorize what the teacher narrates; this limits creative power among the students.
  - On the other hand, the problem-posing method involves only a "cognitive" phase where the teacher is "cognitive" at all times, whether it's while the lesson is being prepared or while they are in dialogue with the students, and the students are essentially co-investigators with the teachers; this allows for the emergence of consciousness among the students


#### Main idea of assigned paragraph with details

Problem-posing education actually allows students to think critically about the world they live in rather than being gullible and just receiving knowledge from a teacher in banking education. 


#### Summary of Banking Concept in 3 sentences

The banking concept is basically where there is a teacher that "deposits" knowledge into students, who are just considered as objects that receive information. This is designed so that they can adapt to the system and become more oppressed, and also limits their creativity. Problem-posing education is a solution to this as it allows both the teacher and the students to teach each other and allows the students to think critically and be creative.


#### Questions

1) *Do you agree with Friere's argument? Explain why if you do and if you do not.*

I agree with part of Friere's argument. They mainly say that education is purely based on the banking concept and that problem-posing education is the best solution. While it does make sense that problem-posing education and the way the describe it is a good solution to the banking concept, I feel like I haven't really felt "oppressed" or anything like that while learning at school, so I don't think education, or at least my education, is purely based on the banking concept. I disagree with Friere saying that education is based on the banking concept. However, I think it makes sense that students and teachers should be co-investigators and think critically about whatever they are learning, as Friere described in problem-posing education, so I do agree with that part. At the end of the day, teachers still usually know more than students, so they should still be considered "higher" than students educationally, but not to the point where the students are "oppressed."

2) *Can you give 2 examples to support your opinion on Friere's work.*

One example that supports my opinion is my college computer science class. The teacher usually does know more than us, so he is teaching us mostly rather than the other way around. However, he is open to ideas from students, and we don't really feel "oppressed." 

#### Dialogue with Dave

It is probably true that while the banking concept hasn’t really applied to me in my education, it is more common in education systems in other countries. However, I think this still shows how Friere’s main argument doesn’t necessarily apply to all of education in general, only in some certain places. Since this is a pretty oppressive system of education, even the banking concept is probably only there in countries where the education system isn’t as good. It is probably also true that my argument that it makes sense for teachers and students to be co-investigators, but also that the teachers should still be a little “higher” than students on a teaching level, isn’t super clear and seems like they are contradicting each other. What I am mainly trying to say is that in problem-posing education, teachers and students should still be co-investigators as Friere says, and they should be giving ideas to each other so the teacher could modify the lesson based on how the students feel, but it should still be more of the teacher teaching the students rather than the other way around, since at the end of the day teachers still usually know more than students.
