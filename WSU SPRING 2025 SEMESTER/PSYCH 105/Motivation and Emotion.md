### What is Motivation

- Dimensional behavior
	- Frequency: How often we engage in the behavior
	- Duration: How long we engage in the behavior
	- Intensity: How hard we go at the behavior
- **Motive**: our natural tendency to approach positive things while avoiding negative ones
	- Example: we tend to be motivated to study to earn good grades while avoiding bad grade, and a waste of money/time
- **Motivation**: Being moved into action or engaging in behavior directed to some end (goal-directed)
	- Can be biological as well as intrinsic and extrinsic
		- **Intrinsic**: personal satisfaction
			- "From within"
		- **Extrinsic**: receive something from others
			- "From external factors"
- **Incentives**: any reward or aversive stimulus we expect in our environment -- based on behavior
- Required resources for motivation:
	- Physical energy
	- Psychological (mental) energy
	- Knowledge
	- Competence
	- Growth

### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation

- Often, we are motivated by factors in both categories
- Extrinsic motivators can enhance or diminish intrinsic motivation
	- Being paid for something you love may not actually be so great! **(Over-justification effect)**
	- Receiving praise can increase intrinsic motivation
		- Interventions for promoting behavior change in children and adults!
- Expecting a reward decreases intrinsic motivation
- A surprise reward maintains and reinforces intrinsic motivation
	- Maybe this is why variable reinforcement schedules work so well?

### Learning and Motivation

- More intrinsic motivation when students feel they are respected and they belong
- Providing activities that are challenging but manageable increases motivation
- Reducing emphasis on evaluation and giving students some control over the learning environment can help!

### Intrinsic (Internal) Motivation

- Arises from within
- Involves:
	- **Needs**: deficiency in life resources important to the organism
		- Food, water, sleep, etc.
	- **Drives**: states of tension/uneasiness
		- Hunger, thirst, tiredness, etc.
	- **Motivated behavior**: actions to reduce drive

### Extrinsic (External) Motivation

- Arises from outside (environment)
- Based on incentives and rewards:
	- Secondary reinforcements to get primary reinforcements
	- Social demands

### Types of Needs

- Physical/biological needs:
	- Nutrients/food
	- Water
	- Air
	- Shelter
	- Temperature
	- Sex
- Psychological needs
	- Affiliation
	- Competence
	- Achievement
	- Power
	- Closer
	- Happiness/purpose

### Theories About Motivation

##### Instinct Theory of Motivation

- William James (1842 - 1912)
- **Instinct Theory**: behavior driven by instincts with aid survival
- Instincts were species-specific patterns of behavior not learned
- Criticized because of poor definitions of instinct
	- Undeniable role of learning in shaping human behavior

##### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

- Lower level needs to be satisfied before upper-level ones
- Levels (bottom to top)
	- Physiological needs (food, water, warmth, rest)
	- Safety needs (security, safety)
	- Belongingness and love needs (intimate relationships, friends)
	- Esteem needs (prestige, feeling of accomplishment)
	- Self-actualization needs (achieving one's full potential, including creative activities)

##### Drive Theory

- Based on the principle of homeostasis
	- **Homeostasis**: maintaining balance at an optimal level
- **Drive Theory**: systems (usually the brain) monitor the body and direct actions to correct deviations from homeostasis
	- <u>Deviation from homeostasis creates psychological need</u>
		- Drive states promote various behaviors
		- Behaviors that help to achieve homeostasis are likely to be repeated in the future

### Self-Efficacy and Social Motives

- Bandura argues self-efficacy is important for motivation
	- Our expectations of consequences of our behaviors are important
	- So it is our belief that we have some ability to alter our future
	- Believing you can achieve at the highest level...
		- Take on challenges
		- Be resilient to setbacks
- Theorized **social motives**: need to <u>affiliation</u> and <u>intimacy</u>
	- Henry Murray
		- **Ambition**: achievement and recognition
		- **Human power**: dominance and aggression
		- **Interpersonal affection**: play

### Emotion and Mood

- **Emotion**: acute, intense, and reactive affective state
	- Set goals and inform decisions
	- Provide context to the world
- **Mood**: prolonged, less-intense affective state
- Types of Emotion
	- Intrinsic: temperament/innate emotions
	- Extrinsic: development of self-control of emotions via the external environment
- Gender can affect regulation of emotions
- Ability to recognize and produce facial expressions of emotions appears to be universal
- Physiology + Psychology + Experience = Emotion

### Neuroscience and Emotion

- Sympathetic nervous system activation produces an arousal response
	- **Hypothalamus**: activation of sympathetic nervous system
	- **Amygdala**: processing of emotional info and sending that info to cortex
	- **Hippocampus**: integrates emotional experience with cognition
- Some emotions are related to specific biological correlates
	- Fear = decreases skin temperature (cold feet)
	- Anger = increased skin temperature (hot under the collar)

### Fear

- **Amygdala**: Part of limbic system
	- Activates in response to threatening stimuli
	- Evaluates significance of stimuli
- Rats with a damaged amygdala cannot be classically conditioned to acquire a fear response
- Humans with a damaged amygdala have a "psychic blindness" -- an inability to recognize fear in facial expressions and voice

### Nature vs. Nurture: Emotions

- Nature Perspective
	- Darwin (1872): Facial expressions are innate/inborn
	- Similar expressions across cultures (Ekman et al., 1969)
	- Suggests evolutionary adaptive advantage
	- Universal recognition of basic emotions
- Nurture Perspective
	- Display rules: Cultural standards for emotional expression
	- Learned through socialization from infancy
	- Vary by culture, gender, and context
		- Examples: Americans value "service with a smile"; Japanese display negative emotions less

### Facial-Feedback Hypothesis

- Facial expressions not only reflect but influence emotions
- Facial muscles send information to the brain
- Duchenne smiles (real smiles) linked to positive experiences
- Even forced expressions can generate corresponding feelings

### Adaptive Value of Negative Emotions

- Fear serves survival function
	- **Impact bias**: overestimating emotional reactions
	- **Focalism**: overestimating focus on a single event
	- **Immune neglect**: failing to recognize emotional defenses
- Leads to greater survival of species
	- Activated in aversive contexts
- Automatic and mostly "impenetrable to cognitive control"
- Processed primarily in the amygdala
	- Prepared learning: Biologically prepared to learn certain associations

### Adaptive Value of Positive Emotions: The Broaden-and-Build Model (Fredrickson)

- Widens cognitive perspective
	- Promotes thinking more broadly and creatively
- Builds psychological resources
	- Enhances program-solving abilities
- Creates "upward spirals" of emotional well-being
	- Increases life satisfaction
- Both positive and negative emotions aid survival, but in different ways
	- Negative: immediate threats
	- Positive: long-term skills and resources
