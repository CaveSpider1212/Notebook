### Wellness Related to Behavior

- Going for a walk:
	- Physical: Exercise benefits
	- Emotional: Destress and unwind
	- Environmental: Communing with nature (especially in parks)
	- Social: Walking with others facilitates connections
	- Spiritual: Time for reflection and connection with nature
	- Intellectual: Conversations while walking stimulate thinking
	- Financial: Free form of exercise compared to gym memberships
- Studying more regularly:
	- Emotional: Reduces stress from last minute cramming
	- Financial: Avoiding costs of failing/repeating courses
	- Intellectual: Better mastery of material
	- Occupational: Better grades open more career doors

### Illness vs. Disease

- **Illness**: Being sick with diagnosed symptoms
- **Disease**: Physical damage within the body (which may exist without symptoms)

According to the American Diabetes Association, in 2021, approximately 25% of the 38.4 million Americans with diabetes didn't know they had it.

### Go to the Doctors: Factors Influencing Medical Care

1. **Stress**: Recent stressors (less than 3 weeks old) often lead people to attribute symptoms to stress rather than illness, reducing care-seeking behavior
2. **Personality**: People higher in neuroticism tend to report symptoms and seek care more frequently
3. **Gender**: Women are generally more likely to seek care for various conditions, including falls, mental health issues, and preventative care
4. **Stigma**: Prevents many from seeking needed care, particularly for mental health conditions. Three forms include:
	- Public stigma: Societal prejudice and discrimination
	- Label avoidance: Avoiding care to prevent being labeled with a disorder
	- Self-stigma: Internalizing negative stereotypes and prejudice
5. **Age**: Young adults typically seek care less frequently; older adults often distinguish between age-related changed and disease symptoms
6. **Religiosity**: Studies show that some religious individuals may delay seeking care, especially if they only discuss symptoms with religious figures rather than medical professionals
7. **Symptomology**: We're more likely to seek care when symptoms are:
	- Easily visible
	- Perceived as severe
	- Significant interference with daily activities
	- Occur frequently

### Alternative Information Sources

- Internet source: WebMD, Wikipedia (which studies have found to be surprisingly reliable for health information)
- Family and friends: Personal experiences and advice
- Support groups: Shared experiences with specific conditions
- Traditional media: TV, radio, books, brochures, medical journals
- Telephone hotlines: For immediate guidance

### Understanding Adherence

**Adherence** refers to both:
- The willingness to follow medical advice
- The ability to implement recommended changes

**Barriers**:
1. Patient-related Factors:
	- Perceptions of disease severity
	- Low motivation
	- Medication costs
	- Misunderstanding the disease or treatment
2. Physician-related Factors:
	- Complex treatment regimens
	- Poor explanation of benefits/side effects
	- Not involving patients in decision-making
3. Healthcare System Factors:
	- Lack of healthcare coordination
	- Limited access to care
	- Prohibitive drug costs
	- High copayments

### Improving Adherence

- Discussing unique needs with physicians
- Exploring generic medication options to reduce costs
- Forming consistent medication routines
- Learning about your condition and medications
- Using one pharmacy for all prescriptions
- Implementing reminder systems
- Tracking medication use

### Understanding Pain

**Pain**: "a sharp unpleasant sensation usually felt in some specific part of the body"

- Acute pain:
	- Brief duration, sudden onset, clear source, adaptive (signals danger)
	- Example: Touching a hot surface (burn)
	- Generally good prognosis, as removing the cause alleviates the pain
- Chronic pain:
	- Persists for months/years, comes and goes, disrupts normal patterns (sleep, appetite), result of disease or injury, not adaptive
	- Examples: Arthritis, migraines, back problems
	- More complex prognosis, often requiring ongoing treatment/management

### Treating Pain

1. Medication Options:
	- Over-the-counter medications
	- Painkillers
2. Surgical Solutions:
	- Pain pump infusions
	- Spinal cord stimulation implants
	- TENS units
	- Bioelectric therapy
3. Non-Medical Approaches:
	- Massage therapy
	- Acupuncture
	- Psychotherapy -- behavior modification
	- Physical therapy/exercise

### Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAMS)

**Complementary**: Used alongside conventional medicine
**Alternative**: Used in place of conventional medicine

- Natural products:
	- Herbs, probiotics, vitamins
- Mind and body practices:
	- Massage therapy, chiropractic care, yoga, acupuncture
- Other approaches:
	- Traditional healers, Ayurvedic medicine, Traditional Chinese medicine, Homeopathy, Naturopathy

### Stress and Coping: A Conceptual Model

1. **Demand**: Anything with potential to exceed a person's resources
2. **Resources**: What we use to manage demands
3. **Strain**: Pressure experienced when resources are insufficient
4. **Problem-focused Coping**: Finding solutions to demands
5. **Stress**: Magnified strain; intense emotional reaction
6. **Emotion-focused Coping**: Managing emotional reactions to stress

##### Types of Demand

1. Daily Hassles: Petty annoyances that take a daily toll
	- Pressure, frustration, conflict
2. Stressors: Environmental demands requiring change or adaptation

##### Problem-Focused Coping (PFC)

- **Confrontation**: Attacking a problem head-on

- **Compromise**: Finding solutions that work for all parties
	- Example: Agreeing to see different movies on different weekends
- **Withdrawal**: Avoiding a situation when other coping forms aren't practical
	- Example: Dropping a course that's too difficult

##### Emotion-Focused Coping (EFC)

1. **Wishful Thinking**: Hoping a bad situation resolves itself
2. **Distancing**: Choosing not to deal with a situation temporarily
3. **Emphasizing the Positive**: Focusing on good aspects and downplaying negatives
4. **Self-Blame**: Attributing problems to personal failings
5. **Tension Reduction**: Behaviors aimed at reducing stress (comfort foods, exercise)
