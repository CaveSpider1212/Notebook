### Info about Fish

Fish has written a lot (about 200) of books and articles about law. Law is typically something that expects good grammar and language and also using Standard English in order to be successful in the position, so that's probably why Fish is a believer in Standard English. Fish has also had a long career as a professor at many universities across the country, which makes him more credible. Some of these universities include Ivy League universities, which likely makes him more privileged which prevents him from seeing the other side of his argument.

### Fish's Stance

- Fish mainly argues that it's important to be fluent in Standard English in order to be successful in life, and having your own identity or style could lead to failure in life
- Fish cares a lot more about the form of the writing rather than the content
