- **Structure** or **Model**: mathematical construct consisting of
	- A set of elements
		- Real numbers
		- Integers
		- Rationals
		- A data structure (list, set, tree, etc.)
	- Relations on those elements
		- $x < y$ (makes sense for some sets)
		- $x$ is a successor/child of $y$ (makes sense for lists/trees)
		- $x = y$ (always makes sense)
	- Functions mapping elements to other elements
		- Binary functions like $+$, $-$, $*$, $/$
		- Unary functions like successor/predecessor

- **Discrete structures**: Structures of elements "separated by gaps"
	- Opposite of a continuous structure, which has no "holes" or "gaps"
		- Examples of continuous structures:
			- Real and complex numbers (with the usual relations/functions)
	- Examples of discrete structures:
		- Integers and natural numbers (including 0)
		- Any finite structure
		- Any data structure in CS
