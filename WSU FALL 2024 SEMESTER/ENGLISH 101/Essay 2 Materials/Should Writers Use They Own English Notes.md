Text: [[Should Writers Use They Own English.pdf]]

### Notes from the Reading

- People of color seem to be "prejudiced" against because they basically speak a different from of English, and white people are treated better because they speak what is considered by a lot of people as "standard English" and not "Black English" or any other English dialect or accent like that
- It's not really the language that gets people to prejudice against people of color, but it's the attitudes about the way they talk and their perceptions of the language
- Young is responding to Stanley Fish's argument about language, and Fish argues about the standard language ideology, where all languages stem from one central language and that people can talk how they want to at home
	- Young is saying that Fish may not be aware he is arguing for language discrimination
	- He does also say Fish isn't completely wrong, saying Fish is right about how writing teachers should focus more on writing and less on other topics (war, feminism, etc.)
- Young argues that "Black English" isn't as different from "standard English" as a lot of people think, and the words and other things like that are mostly similar
	- They are still the same language, so teachers can't teach students "another language" (standard English) if they talk in a different accent or dialect (Black English, for example)
	- He also says Fish's argument is hypocritical that students "have a right" but are still forced to leave behind their own language and dialect and adopt the "standard English"
- Young argues that students should learn and understand multiple dialects of English (and that's what a lot of people do anyways) as it's easier to understand accents and know a little more about people
	- He addresses a counterargument that you can't really mix dialects at work because people wouldn't understand you, and also brings up a fact from somebody else that a third of the nation's blue-chip workers write poorly
		- To respond to this, he says that people apply rules to these dialects that lead to stereotypes that they need "remedial training" or that the speakers of those dialects are dumb
- Young argues that rather than prescribing how people should write or speak (as Fish said), they should be taught language descriptively, and teach how language functions within and from cultural perspectives, and learn multiple dialects simultaneously
- According to Young, Fish's argument of standard language ideology insists that minority people can't have high ranking positions anywhere just because of their accent or dialect of the exact same language, while white people would because they tend to speak "standard English"

### Summary of assigned reading

"Don't get me wrong..."

Fish's argument about language is mostly wrong, but not completely wrong. His argument that writing teachers should focus more on writing and less on other themes (war, feminism, etc.) makes sense. Fish also says that if any student tries to say they have a right to their own language or dialect, the teacher must say that they are teaching another language (standard English) to them instead of taking their own language away.
