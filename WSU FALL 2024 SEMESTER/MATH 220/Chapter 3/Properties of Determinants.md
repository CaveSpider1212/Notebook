> [!tip] Theorem: Row Operations and the Determinant
> 
> 1. If a multiple of one row of $A$ is added to another row to produce a matrix $B$, then det$B$ = det$A$.
> 2. If two rows of $A$ are interchanged to produce $B$, then det$B$ = -det$A$.
> 3. If one row of $A$ is multiplied by $k$ to produce $B$, then det$B$ = $k$det$A$.

> [!tip] Theorem
> A square matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if det$A \neq$ 0.

> [!tip] Theorem
> If $A$ is an $n$ x $n$ matrix, then det$A^T$ = det$A$.

> [!tip] Theorem: Multiplicative Property of Determinants
> If $A$ and $B$ are $n$ x $n$ matrices, then det$(AB)$ = (det$A$)(det$B$).
