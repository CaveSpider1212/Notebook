### Terms

**Developmental Psychology**: study of patterns of growth, stability, and change during the lifespan

- Growth: movement from simple to complex/maturing
- Stability: period when growth is complete and abilities peak
- Change: later decline as body shows signs of wear and tear
	- Primary aging: natural age-related changes
	- Secondary aging: changes affected by behavior and environment

### Developmental Periods

1. Infancy/Toddlerhood (birth-3 years)
2. Preschool Years (3-6 years)
3. Middle Childhood (6-12 years)
4. Adolescence (12-20 years)
5. Early Adulthood (20-40 years)
6. Middle Adulthood (40-65 years)
7. Late Adulthood (65+ years)

### Types of Development

- Physical development: body changes and how they affect behavior
- Cognitive development: changes in intellectual abilities
- Social/personality development: social interactions and personality changes

### Principles of Development

- Cephalocaudal principle: Development proceeds from head to toe
	- Your nervous system develops before you can walk or run
- Proximodistal principle: Development proceeds from near to far
	- Development of gross and fine motor skills
- Hierarchical integration: Development goes from simple to complex
	- Before you can pick up objects with your hands, you must learn to control individual fingers
- Independence of systems: Different bodily systems develop at different rates

### Infancy - Physical Development

- Brain development and efficiency
	- Synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning
- Reflexes and their adaptive function
- Sensory systems development
	- Touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision
- Depth perception (visual cliff experiment)
- Motor skill development
	- Gross motor vs. fine motor skills

### Infancy - Cognitive Development

- Piaget's Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years) -- Six substages
	1. Reflexes
	2. Primary circular reactions
	3. Secondary circular reactions
	4. Coordination of secondary schemas
	5. Tertiary circular reactions
	6. Mental representation
- Object permanence
- Language development
	- Prelinguistic communication
	- Babbling
	- First words and sentences
	- Motherese (infant-directed speech)

### Infancy - Social/Personality Development

- Parenting styles
	- Authoritarian, Authoritative, Permissive, Uninvolved
- Attachment styles
	- Secure, Avoidant, Ambivalent, Disorganized
- Sociability development
	- Social smiling and stranger anxiety
	- Social referencing
- Play development
- Erikson's Trust vs. Mistrust stage

### Preschool Years - Development Overview

- Physical development
	- Growth and motor skill refinement
- Cognitive development
	- Preoperational stage (Piaget)
	- Language expansion
- Social/Personality development
	- Initiative vs. Guilt (Erikson)
	- Aggression development
	- Prosocial behavior development

### Middle Childhood - Developmental Overview

- Physical development
	- Motor skill refinement
	- Health concerns (obesity)
- Cognitive development
	- Concrete operations stage
	- Memory strategies
	- Metacognition
- Social/Personality development
	- Industry vs. Inferiority (Erikson)
	- Self-concept changes
	- Moral development (Kohlberg)
	- Aggression changes

### Adolescence - Physical Development

- Puberty (12-20)
	- Growth spurt
	- Primary and secondary sex characteristics
		- Primary: reproduction organs
		- Secondary: not needed for reproduction
- Body image concerns
	- Eating disorders

### Adolescence - Cognitive Development

- Formal operations stage (Piaget)
	- Abstract thinking
	- Propositional thought
	- Hypothetico-deductive reasoning
- Adolescent egocentrism (Elkind)
	- Imaginary audience: constantly being watched/judged
	- Personal fable: unrealistic sense of their own uniqueness

### Adolescence - Social/Personality Development

- Identity vs. Role confusion (Erikson)
- Marcia's identity statuses
	- Identity achievement: goes through the crisis and comes to a commitment
	- Identity foreclosure: does not go through the crisis but comes out will a commitment
	- Moratorium: goes through a crisis but not arriving at a commitment
	- Identity diffusion: there is no crisis or commitment
- Need for autonomy
- Peer relationships and popularity

### Early Adulthood - Development Overview

- Physical development
	- Peak physical condition
	- Beginning of senescence
- Intimacy vs. Isolation (Erikson)
- Career development
- Relationship formation
- Parenthood

### Middle Adulthood - Development Overview

- Physical changes
	- Vision, hearing, reaction time changes
	- Menopause
- Generativity vs. Stagnation (Erikson)
- Midlife transitions: assess the past and make changes for the future
- Family changes
	- Empty nest syndrome
	- Boomerang children
	- Sandwich generation
	- Grandparenthood

### Late Adulthood - Development Overview

- Physical changes
	- Sensory decline
	- Motor changes
- Cognitive changes:
	- Memory decline
- Ego Integrity vs. Despair (Erikson)
- Successful aging theories
	- Activity theory: stay active = age better
	- Selective optimization: Concentrate on skill areas to compensate for losses in other areas
	- Continuity theory: involvement in society to maximize their sense of well-being and self-esteem
- Death and dying (Kubler-Ross stages)

### Key Theories in Developmental Psychology

- Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory
- Erikson's Psychosocial Development Theory
- Kohlberg's Moral Development Theory
- Attachment Theory
