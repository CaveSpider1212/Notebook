### Four Forms of External Intervention

1. Ending civil wars
2. Peacekeeping
3. Foreign-imposed regime change
4. Nation-building

### External Intervention: UN Peacekeeping

Consequences of peacekeeping: there are positive and statistically significant relationships between:

- Presence of UN peacekeepers and lower rates of civilian and combatant deaths
- Peacekeeping missions and the geographic containment of violence, such that violence does not spread within a country or across borders
- Credible promise of peacekeeping mission and signing a peace agreement
- Peacekeeping missions and more durable peace (non-resumption of old war or onset of new war)

### External Intervention: Creating the Conditions for Self-Sustaining Peace?

Peacekeeping missions have been much less effective at institutional reforms that would eliminate the underlying structural causes of civil wars: weak state institutions, weak democracies or autocracies, and extractive economic institutions that do not promote widely-shared prosperity.

### Can Democracy Be Imposed?

States that experience foreign-imposed regime change initiated by democracies on average gain no significant democratic benefit compared with similar states where democracies did not intervene.

### The Insignificance of Foreign-Imposed Regime Changes

On average, a FIRC by a democracy raises the polity score by 1/10 of a point every year; this effect is not statistically significant.

### Nation-Building

- **Nation-building**: a form of foreign intervention, usually during or subsequent to a destructive civil or international war, in which the occupying power attempts to rebuild the basic institutions of a "failed state."
	- Strengthen and reform state institutions
	- Reconstruct and rebuild economy as a market-based system
	- Draft new constitution supporting electoral democracy

Successful American nation-building? Germany and Japan after WWII.

Unsuccessful nation-building? Afghanistan (post-2001) and Iraq (post-2003) - but also dozens of lesser-known cases in the 19th and 20th centuries.

### Germany and Japan as Models for Afghanistan and Iraq

Germany and Japan: global powers prior to WWII, this is how they were able to start the war!

America reconstructs what was largely already there, imposes democracy on institutions, probs up domestic forces who were anti-fascists

What is the institutional landscape all the other places America has tried to nation-build?

### Brownlee on American Nation-Building

Nation-building has succeeded **only where American nation builders inherited a functioning state.**

Outside the developed world, American nation-building has confronted far less hospitable conditions (failed states) and hence has achieved only modest success, if even that.

### Selection Bias

Claims about the likelihood of successful nation-building based on the cases of Germany and Japan reflect **selection bias**: selection on very prominent instances of success, neglect of far more numerous cases of failed nation-building.

The probability of successful nation-building is the ratio of the number of successful cases to the total number of cases (successful + failed).

### Why the Persistent Failures?

Sargon the Conqueror: the radius of conquest is larger than the radius of administration

Even modern nation-builders must delegate authority to local agents.

Common outcome: political concessions made "to the very elites \[Americans] intended to replace and deferred to the societies they meant to transform."

- It is incredibly difficult to completely displace local power structures.
- Think back to where we began: the Military Revolution and *centuries* of external and internal warfare.
- We tend to think of countries as "blank slates" such that once we topple the dictator, we can write a constitution, rebuild schools, and go home.
- Local power holders *always* step into the breach.
- Germany and Japan are different precisely because they built powerful centralized states *before the US occupation began*.

### Making Things Worse?

- FIRCs may make civil war more likely through their effects on state infrastructural power.
- Some FIRCs involve the destruction of a state's infrastructural power, both military and civilian bureaucracy.
- The destruction of these assets make insurgency more likely, both because state capacity to deter violence and engage in counter-insurgency is low, and because without a state to provide protection and other goods and services, citizens will transfer loyalty to locally powerful armed organizations.

### The Normative Lesson of Careful Causal Analysis

Nation-building can be justified on strictly normative grounds.

But intervention is a form of causation: ethical intervention also requires reasons to believe that the intervention will cause normatively desirable outcomes

Intervention may not be normally justified once the probability of success is taken into account
