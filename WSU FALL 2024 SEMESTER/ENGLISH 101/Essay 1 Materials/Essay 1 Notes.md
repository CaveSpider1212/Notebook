#### Summary order

- Education is mainly depositing knowledge form the teacher to the student, very similar to banking.
- In the banking concept, teachers consider themselves knowledgeable, and they consider students to know nothing, which is how the teacher justifies their existence. Students also seem to accept their ignorance and "adapt" to the system, which allows for them to justify the teacher's existence. Basically they see each other as contradicting each other, or as polar opposites. The subjects, in this case students, are basically considered as only objects that receive information. This is almost identical to oppressive societies in real life.
- In the banking concept, the education provided essentially makes students gullible to believe that and make them adapt to the oppressive system.
- Because students seem to adapt to the system that the teachers force on them in the banking system, it limits their room for creative power, and the teachers also appear to control the thinking of the students in this system. Basically, the more the "oppressors" (teachers) can get the "oppressed" (students) to adapt to that situation, the more easily they can be dominated (given knowledge).
- Sooner or later, the "deposits" that teachers give to the students can lead to them realizing the contradiction that the banking concept of education is trying to maintain them in, and the students will try to liberate themselves from the system.
- The problem with liberation is that those who are involved in liberation are surrounded and influenced by the environment that creates the banking concept, and often don't see its significance or power in dehumanizing its subjects or patients, so they use the same method of alienation in trying to liberate from the banking concept. Those that want to liberate from the banking concept must reject the banking concept in its entirety, and instead have a concept of people as conscious beings.
- Basically, a solution for this is not to "integrate" the oppressed into the structure of oppression (or make them adapt), but to change the structure so that the "oppressed" can become "beings for themselves," which is against the oppressors' purpose. That is why oppressors even use the banking concept in the first place.
- More specifically, a solution to the oppressive banking concept is having teachers essentially be partners with the students and have trust in their creative power, but the banking concept of education does not allow for such partnership.
- Since students must truly reject the banking concept and all of its qualities in order to be truly liberated from it, the best solution to this oppressive system is problem-posing education. Problem-posing education actually breaks the vertical system of banking education. However, this is only done by overcoming the contradiction between teachers and students, which is replacing the "teacher-of-the-students" and "students-of-the-teacher" ideas with "teacher-student" and "student-teacher," where the teacher and students teach each other through dialogue.
- Unlike the banking concept, problem-posing education actually allows students to think critically about the world they live in rather than being gullible and just receiving knowledge from a teacher in banking education.
- While the banking concept consists of "cognitive" and "narrative" stages, where they essentially come up with something that can be identified for their lesson and narrate that lesson to the students, expecting them to absorb the information, problem-posing education consists of the teacher being "cognitive" at all times, including while the lesson is being prepared and while they are in dialogue with students. Students also serve as co-investigators of the lesson with the teacher, and it allows for their ability to critically think.

#### Notes about the essay

- Very confusing and hard to read
- Author does not provide a lot of examples of their argument, particularly ones that are relevant to us in our own society, so it's hard for us to relate to them and their arguments
