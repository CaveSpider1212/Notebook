### Key Questions in Behavioral Response

1. What sensory structures detect the event?
2. How is information transmitted to the brain?
3. Which brain structures process the information?
4. How does the brain interpret the event?
5. How does the body receive response commands?

### Intro to Biology and Behavior

- **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Brain and spinal cord, controls automatic and intentional behavior
- **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: somatic (body) nerves, control movement, touch, pain, etc. in the body, connected to the CNS

### What Lies Beyond: The Peripheral Nervous System

##### Autonomic Nervous System

- Characteristics
	- Regulates involuntary activity
	- Has two divisions involved in physiological responses to stress or crisis situations
		- Sympathetic nervous system
		- Parasympathetic nervous system

###### Sympathetic

- Fight or flight response
- Intense arousal
- Emergency readiness

###### Parasympathetic

- Returns body to rest state
- Calming function
- Restoration

##### Somatic Nervous System

- Characteristics: includes sensory nerves and motor nerves
	- Controls voluntary movement
	- Manages skeletal muscles
	- Carries sensory information

##### The Supporting Systems

###### Sensory neurons

- Receive information about the environment from the sensory systems and convey this to the brain for processing

###### Motor neurons

- Carry information from the CNS to produce movement
- Provide mechanism regulated by spinal cord and brain

###### Interneurons

- Resides in the brain and spinal cord
- Act as bridges connecting sensory and motor neurons

### Terms

- **Genotype**: genetic make of an organism
- **Phenotype**: observable characteristics of an organism
	- Susceptible to environmental influence
	- **Epigenetics**

### How Genes Influence Behaviors

- Genetic disorders: genotype directly leads to a behavioral phenotype
	- Don syndrome (Trisomy 21)
	- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Gene x Environment interactions: effects of the genotype are moderated by the environment

### Neurons

- Cell that is specialized for communicating information from one part of the body to another
- The brain contains an estimated 100 billion neurons

##### The Neuron

- **Neuron**: primary type of cell that makes up the brain
- **Soma**: cell body, nucleus, genetic material, and organelles, the "brain" of the cell, "gray matter" of the brain
- **Dendrites**: receives information from other cells
- **Axon**: sends information to other cells (Electrochemical messages)
- **Terminal buttons**: secrete NTs into synapse
- **Synapse**: gap between two sets of dendrites where messages are sent
- **Myelin sheath**: fatty layer on the axon that insulates and protects it and speeds transmission, "white matter" of the brain
	- Important in Multiple Sclerosis
	- **Glial cells**: make and maintain the myelin sheath and protect the brain from infection

##### Glial Cells

- Glial to neuron = 1 : 1
- Glia is Greek for "glue"
	- Provide structural support for neurons
- Types of Glial cells
	- **Microglia** remove waste from the nervous system (e.g., dead and damaged neurons)
	- **Astrocytes** provide connections between neurons
	- **Oligodendrocytes** from myelin sheaths in the brain
	- **Radial glial** generate new cells - neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes
	- **Schwann** from myelin sheaths in the rest of the nervous system

##### Myelin Sheath

- **Action potential (AP)**: the neuron's way of communicating with other neurons; an electrical impulse that travels down the axon to the terminal buttons, causing the release of neurotransmitters (NT's) into the synapse
	- AP "skips" over the segments of myelin, hopping from one node to the next, instead of traversing the entire length of the axon
- **Myelin sheath** insulates and protects the tiny spikes in electricity happening inside the axon

### How do Neurons Communicate with Each Other?

- **Neurotransmitters**: chemical messengers in the brain
	- Released from **Terminal Buttons** into synapse
	- Bind with **receptor sites** on adjacent dendrites to stimulate neighboring neurons
- **Receptor sites**
	- Location where neurotransmitters attach on the receiving side of the synaptic gap (on dendrites)

##### Neurotransmitters

- **Receptor site**
	- NT fits in like a key fits into a lock
	- **Reuptake**: process by which neurotransmitters are reabsorbed by the sending terminal bud
- **Enzymatic degradation**: another way to get rid of neurotransmitters

###### Inhibition vs. Excitation

- Neurotransmitters bind to receptor sites
- **Inhibitory** neurotransmitters <u>are not</u> stimulatory, and reduce the rate of firing
- **Excitatory** neurotransmitters <u>are</u> stimulatory and increase the rate of firing

### Synaptic Transmission

##### Resting Potential

- Resting potential: -70 mV
	- Negative ions inside cell (Cl-)
	- Positive ions outside cell (NA+, K+)
- Solutions on either side of the membrane wall come into equilibrium; slightly more negative charge inside

##### Action Potential

- Action potential: +30 mV
	- Involves spike in electrical energy that passes through the axon of a neuron, the purpose of which is to convey information
- Is "all-or-none"
	- Do not vary in their magnitude, only varies in their frequency
- **Every time a segment of the axon fires**
	- Positive sodium ions flood in from the outside of the cell, while the prior segment returns to its resting potential, all along the length of the axon to its end

##### Threshold Potential

- Threshold potential: -55 mV
- All or none principle
	- If a neuron reaches -55mV, it will fire and reach a peak charge of +30 mV
- Refractory peirod
	- Can't fire again until charge goes back to resting -70 mV

### Inhibition & Excitation

- Excitatory signals
	- Cause more action potentials to occur
	- Occur when enough combine, sending neurons signal to the receiving neuron to pass along message
	- Excitatory (+) neurotransmitters cause neurons to fire more
		- Norepinephrine, Glutamate, Dopamine
- Inhibitory signals
	- Inhibit neurons from releasing a signal through the axon
	- Inhibitory neurotransmitters cause neurons to fire less
		- Serotonin, GABA

### Neurotransmitters

- Chemical messengers released at the synapse
	- Inhibit or excite post-synaptic (receiving) neuron
- Can have many different functions depending on brain area or neural pathway they are released into
- Normal brain function depends on the right balance of neurotransmitters in the brain
	- Deficits and excesses can lead to disorders
		- Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety
- Psychoactive drugs can mimic, enhance, or block the effects of neurotransmitters

### The Major Neurotransmitters

- **Serotonin (5-HT) (-)**: behavior (inhibition), mood, thought
	- OCD, depression
- **Dopamine (DA) (+)**: pleasure-seeking behavior (excitation), movement
	- Schizophrenia, depression, drug addiction
- **GABA (-)**: inhibition, calming
	- Anxiety, alcohol
- **Norepinephrine/Noradrenaline (NE) (+)**: fight or flight, arousal (excitation)
	- Depression, hypervigilance
- **Acetylcholine (ACh) (+)**: muscle movement, attention, memory
	- Botox blocks ACh receptors to paralyze facial muscles
	- Produced in the brain and the muscles

### Neural Networks

- **Hebb's Law**: neurons that fire together, wire together
	- Neural networks (circuits)
	- Relates to the learning of skills, information, memories
		- Ex: playing an instrument, learning to ride a bike, recalling a memory

### The Brain

- Made up of neurons and glial cells
- Hemispheres (right and left) connected by corpus callosum
	- Lateralization of function
	- Cross-wiring of hemispheres
- **The Cortex**: newer outer layer, higher order functions and interpretation of sensory information
	- **Lobes**: frontal, temporal, occipital, parietal
- **Inner structures**: older structures, fight or flight, emotion, and basic life functions
	- Amygdala, hippocampus, Thalamus, hypothalamus

### The Cortex: A Peek Beneath The Skull

- **Cerebral cortex**: processes information and surrounds nearly all of the brain structure
	- **Association areas**: involves region of cortex that integrates information from all over the brain

### The Hemispheres

- **Cortex**: includes largest, most highly developed part of brain
	- Involved in intelligence, personality, thinking, perceiving, planning and organization, language, sensation, motor functions
	- Divided into right and left hemispheres and connected by corpus callosum

- How do we know what is what?
	- The bumps or raised folds in the cortex are called <u>gyri</u>
	- The valleys or creases in the cortex are called <u>sulci</u>
		- Different sulci and gyri are sometimes responsible for different specific brain functions
	- **Lateralization of function**: the idea that some functions are lateralized, or they are done entirely by one hemisphere rather than being shared by both

- Lateralization - 2 hemispheres are specialized for different roles
	- **Right hemisphere**: understanding abstract and humorous use of language, following conversations that change topics, recognizing faces, spatial and musical ability
	- **Left hemisphere**: language
	- Opposite of Generalization - left hemisphere plays a crucial role in language processing and right hemisphere plays a crucial role in managing visual spatial tasks
- But: hemispheres constantly integrate and share information via corpus callosum
	- **Corpus callosum**: band of white matter tracts which connect the hemispheres

- Split brain
- **Hemispherectomies**
	- Exceptionally rate; last resort
- **Callostomies (split-brain operations)**: right and left hemisphere disconnected
- **Neuroplasticity**: brain undergoes constant alterations
	- Physical adaptation and repair--even after hemispherectomy
	- Growth of new connections and reorganization
- **Stem cells**: responsible for creating new neurons

### Frontal Lobe

- Prefrontal Cortex (PFC): planning, decision making, higher order cognitive functions
- Personality: Phineas Gage frontal lobe damage
- Motor Cortex: Broca's Area

### Parietal Lobe

- Touch, taste, temperature, pain, sensory information
- Somatosensory cortex
- **Hemispheric neglect**: damage to the parietal lobe can result in a syndrome where patients ignore left, and only see right visual field

### Occipital Lobe

- Initial processing site for visual information
- **Primary visual cortex**: connects to optic nerve where visual information is received and interpreted
- **Blindsight**: damage to Occipital lobe can result in a syndrome where patients claim to be blind but respond to objects in visual field, visual pathways still intact but info doesn't reach the conscious level

### Temporal Lobe

- Primary processing of auditory information
	- **Primary Auditory Cortex**
	- Wernicke's Areas
- Memory, language, emotion

### Below the Cortex

- The Limbic System
	- Fuels basic drives (4 F's) - Hypothalamus
	- Processes emotions - amygdala
	- Processes memories - hippocampus
	- **Hippocampus**: primarily responsible for creating new memories
	- **Amygdala**: processes basic emotions, such as fear and aggression, as well as associated memories
	- **Thalamus**: processes and relays sensory information to the appropriate areas of the cortex
	- **Hypothalamus**: maintains a constant internal environment within a healthy range; helps regulate sleep-wake cycles, sexual behavior, and appetite
- Brainstem and cerebellum
	- **Reticular formation**: involves network of neurons running through the midbrain
		- Controls levels of arousal and quickly analyzes sensory information on its way to the cortex
			- Hindbrain
			- Pons
			- Medulla
	- **Cerebellum**: involves muscle coordination and balance
		- Alcohol interferes with function

### Strokes

- **Stroke**: occurs when blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced
	- Blockage or bursting of a blood vessel
- Leading cause of brain damage
	- Aphasia, blindsight, hemi neglect
