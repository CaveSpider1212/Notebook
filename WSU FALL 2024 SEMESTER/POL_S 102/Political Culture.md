### Political Culture

- Norms, values, beliefs, civic values, religion, informal rules
- How individuals think and feel about the political system (Almond and Verba 1963)

### Political Culture Theory - Assumptions

- Posits existence of a relatively homogenous and durable culture, from which people derive their political preferences
- Emphasis on consensus over conflict
  - Shared values and beliefs that form a common citizenry are reflected in the political system
- Politics as from the "bottom up"
  - Shared beliers and values of the people at large that create political systems
  - NOT the actions of political elites or other type of elites
- Theories of political culture tend to make specific claims about preferences while rejecting claims about power

### Political Culture Through the Ages

- Aeschylus, The Persians (472 BC)
  - Distinguished East and West, associates East with despotism, West with democracy
- Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws (1748)
  - Divided political institutions into monarchies, despotisms, and republics (democracies)
  - Associated these with western, eastern, and ancient Greek civilizations
- John Stuart Mill, Representative Government (1861)
  - Need for legislators to take account of "pre-existing habits and feelings" of the people when creating political institutions

### Civic Culture

- Cluster of attitudes, including:
  - Belief on the part of individuals that they can influence political decisions
  - Positive feelings toward the political system
  - High levels of interpersonal trust
  - Preferences for gradual societal change
- People cooperating on all sorts of things, whether it's related to the city or the government

### Putnam: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy

- Study of 20 regional governments in Italy from 1970s to early 1990s
  - Similar political institutions, but differed in their cultural contexts
- Key question: why are regional governments in the north of Italy more effective than regional governments in the south?
  - Northern Italy: strong civic culture
  - More active civil society --> norm of citizens taking part in politics, and social events within their broader community
  - Value of social networks: emphasis on reciprocity and social cooperation
- What makes a successful democracy?
  - A strong level of mutual trust amongst citizens

### Putnam: Bowling Alone

- Focus on the decline of social networks, especially in the US
  - Decline of unions, religious groups, Boy/Girl Scout volunteers, parent-teacher associations, Freemasonry, etc.
    - Broader societal changes: more women entering workplace, urban mobilization, TV and internet
- Negative consequences for American democracy:
  - Decreased voter turnout
  - Decreased work/membership with political parties
  - Growing distrust amongst citizens, and distrust for politicians

### Inglehart: Values and Democratic Stability

- Broad conceptualization of civic culture:
  - A coherent set of personal life satisfaction, political satisfaction, interpersonal trust, and support for the existing social order
  - Countries that rank highly according to these elements are much likelier to be stable democracies
- Operationalization and measurement:
  - Survey data and analysis: industrial countries based on annual surveys between 1973 and 1987
  - How to measure X?
    - To what extent are you satisfied with life as a whole?
    - To what extent do you think most people are trustworthy?
      - Range on a scale of 0 to 10
  - How to measure Y?
    - Number of years that society has had continuous democratic institutions
      
##### Economics matter too for Inglehart

Economic change --> Cultural change --> Stable democracy
Industrialization --> Shift from traditional to secular-rational values --> Civic culture

- Role of technology and economic growth:
  - People have more autonomy over their lives
  - More resources
  - Their concerns shift
- Shift to personal/individual autonomy
  - Move away from all-encompassing religious doctrines that apply to everyone
  - Respect for difference, right to live life as they please (within limits)
  - Self-expression
  - Questioning of authorities, hierarchies, dogmatism
  - This is "secular-rational"
  - THIS is civic culture

### Religion and Democracy: Weber

- The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905)
	- Protestant emphasis on individual responsibility
	- Conducive to capitalism
	- Creates a bourgeoisie
		- A robust middle-class that helped spur further economic development
		- Industrialization
	- Contrast to Catholicism
		- Emphasis on hierarchy (the Pope) as opposed to individual-reading and connection with God (Martin Luther)
		- Examples: Spain and Italy

### Religion and Democracy: Fish

- Islam and Democracy (2002)
- Why?
	- Muslim majority countries --> female subordination --> Authoritarianism
- Just because he didn't give it in the model doesn't mean it doesn't exist (he just didn't test it)
- Evidence
	- 149 countries and "Freedom House scores"
	- Finds that on average, Muslim majority countries (>50% of population) are more likely to be authoritarian
	- Looks at other factors like lower female literacy scores, sex-ratio imbalances
- Why the link between religion and female subordination?
	- Claim that these imbalances reflect in social relations within the family
	- And are reproduced above in political institutions
	- Unquestioned leadership of the father --> culture of domination and intolerance

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Political Culture Theories

- Strengths:
	- Bottom-up --> captures agency/power of citizens
	- Strength of contemporary nationalist movement/right-wing populism
		- Desire for community ties in light of Bowling Alone?
	- Operationalization/measurement: some good survey Qs
		- And multiple ways of understanding culture
- Weaknesses:
	- Assumption of homogeneity problematic?
	- Critique of Inglehart: selection bias of countries
		- He only focuses on industrial countries
		- Over-samples wealthy democracies
	- Haphazard/poor measurement
		- Huntington: hard-to-define mixture of ethnicity and language, and a residual category (Latin America)
