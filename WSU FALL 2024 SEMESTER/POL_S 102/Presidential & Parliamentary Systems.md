### Review

- Overall, posits some congruence between elements of political institutions and other political outcomes.
- Institutions are the "rules of the game" that are designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes.
- Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behavior and punish violations.

### Key debates/ideas on Presidential vs. Parliamentary Systems

- Degree of survival
	- Often argued that parliamentary regimes are more likely to survive
- Tendency for different constitutional frameworks to produce legislative majorities
	- In presidential democracies the executive's party enjoyed legislative majorities 48% of the time
	- In parliamentary democracies, there were majorities 83% of the time
- Duration and reappointment of cabinet ministers
	- "Return ratio" of cabinet minister in parliamentary regimes is about three times higher

### Presidential Systems

- Most common systems throughout the Americas
- President is the head of state
- Emphasis on separation of powers

### Parliamentary Systems

- Executive and legislature linked: former derives legitimacy from the latter
- Head of state usually different to head of government (which is usually the Prime Minister)
- Most common in Europe and throughout the Caribbean
- Most common in the world (41% of democracies)

### Presidential Systems: Mutual Independence

- Electorate select chief executive and then independently selects members of legislature
- A presidential democracy is therefore a system of mutual independence of executive and legislature
- No quick institutional solutions to moments of political crisis
- Chief executive also has the capacity to dissolve legislature and call for new elections

### Parliamentary Systems: Mutual Dependence

- Electorate selects members of parliament and then MPs select an individual as head of government and chief executive (Prime Minister)
- Legislature can dismiss government through **vote of no confidence**
- Chief executive also has the capacity to dissolve legislature

### Coalitions

- Especially common in parliamentary systems, particularly electoral systems of proportional representation
	- Multiple parties, emphasis on representativeness of broad variety of opinions amongst electorate
	- Many small parties can win seats in parliament
- So two or more parties must contribute members to the government to survive a vote of no confidence

##### Types of Coalitions

- **Minimum winning (MWC)**: no extra or surplus parties that are not needed to govern
- **Minimum connected winning**: minimum winning and parties are connected on policy spectrum
- **Minimum size**: as close as possible to minimum number of seats needed (often 50%)
- **Minimum number of parties**: fewest number of parties needed to form majority
- **Median party**: includes the median party in the middle of the political spectrum
- **Minimum range**: minimum number of spaces between parties on policy spectrum

### Juan Linz, The Perils of Presidentialism

- Presidentialism is more unstable than parliamentary systems
- Zero-sum elections:
	- "Presidentialism is inescapably problematic because it operates according to the rule of 'winner-takes-all' - an arrangement that tends to make democratic politics a zero-sum game, with all the potential for conflict".
- The style of presidential politics:
	- "The office of president is by nature two-dimensional and, in a sense, ambiguous: on the one hand, the president is the head of state and the representative of the entire nation: on the other hand, he stands for a clearly partisan political opinion".
- The problem of dual legitimacy:
	- "A presidential cabinet is less likely than its parliamentary counterpart to contain strong and independent-minded members - the officers of a president's cabinet hold their posts purely at the sufferance of their chief..."
	- Both a president and legislature can make a claim to legitimacy
- The issue of stability:
	- "A prime minister who becomes embroiled in scandal or loses the allegiance of his party or majority coalition and whose continuance in office might provoke grave turmoil can be much more easily removed than a corrupt or highly unpopular president".

### Why should parliamentary regimes be more stable?

- **Stepan and Skach (1993)**:
	- Mutual dependence should encourage reconciliation between executive and legislative branches
	- Mutual independence encourages antagonism, which leads to deadlock, and then may turn to the military to break stalemate
	- But in parliamentary regimes there are votes of no confidence, and/or PM can dissolve parliament and call for new elections

- Out of all of the countries that gained independence from 1945 to 1979, 15 of them stayed as a democracy between 1980 to 1989 (and all of them had parliamentary regimes)
- According to Cheibub (2007), parliamentary regimes tend to be richer to begin with

### Parliamentary regimes

Pros:
- Faster and easier to pass legislation
- Can be more beneficial to countries with a population that is divided racially, ethnically, or ideologically (PM does not have as much influence as a president)
- Easy to form new parties
- Minimizes political polarization
- Often requires the formation of coalitions (Ensures no groups/special interests will be favored over the other)

Cons:
- Only the legislature can vote for the head of state/PM but not the electorate
- Coalitions and governments can be unstable, especially if they are minority governments
- Lack of definite election calendar/term limits can be abused (Holding elections when it's in the governing party's best interests)

### Presidential regimes

Pros:
- President is directly elected by the people
- Checks and balances as a result of separation of powers
- If a president has strong powers then they can act quickly
- Presidents have a fixed term, providing more stability than PMs which can be removed at any time.

Cons:
- Potential for gridlock between the two powers
- May be a disadvantage not to be able to remove a president early
- Tendency to authoritarianism due to increased polarization
