### Autocratic Institutions

1. Autocratic regimes have specific dynamics because unlike democracies, there are no established procedures and rules for changing the government.
	- There may be rules for changing the chief executive (especially on the death of the existing chief executive)
2. Autocratic regimes have institutions that are at least partially intended to manage their specific political dynamics.
	- Just as there are varieties of democratic regimes, so there are varieties of autocratic regimes.
3. These distinctive institutions may have consequences for autocratic survival.
	- The death of an autocratic regime is not the same as a democratic transition; inter-autocratic regime transitions are possible.

### Internal Dynamics of Authoritarian Regimes

- Dictatorships contain core ruling elite whose members are the most critical basis of support of a dictatorship and who thus critical positions in the state and government.
- Dictators are often deposed by members of their own support coalition -- call this a palace coup, a change of leadership without a change of regime.
- Therefore, managing this support coalition is a major dynamic of authoritarian politics.
- Simultaneously, autocrats have to worry about two other sources of challenge:
	- Groups of elites excluded from the current authoritarian regime who wish to create a new autocratic regime under their control.
	- Popular uprisings and insurgencies, possibly in support of democracy.

### Types of Dictatorship

2008: 74 dictatorships around the world
- 38 (51.4%) were civilian
- 24 (32.4%) were military
- 12 (16.2%) were monarchies

### A Second Typology of Authoritarian Regimes

- **Military**: officers determine who rules and who influences policy
- **Personalistic**: all decisions depend on discretion of an individual leader
- **Single-party**: access to political office and control over policy are dominated by one party

Most authoritarian regimes combine two or more features.

### Monarchic Dictatorships

- Reliance on family/kin network to stay in and continue power
- A royal family in power
	- NOT the same as constitutional monarchies (democracies) like UK, Spain, Sweden, etc.
- Nowadays, most common in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
- Tend to be more stable and less violent; some more property rights and economic growth
	- Why?
		- Clear rules as to who the insiders and outsiders are
		- Rules and norms that indicate exactly how regime rents are to be shared among the various members of the royal family
		- Institutions that allow members of the royal family to monitor the actions of the monarch and enforce the norms regarding the distribution of regime rents

### Military Dictatorships

- Military leaders form a "junta," or committee
- Values of discipline, cohesiveness, autonomy from civilian intervention
- Are usually volatile and short-lived
- But even if they step down, they remain a credible force: democracies have to take into account the possibility for future coups
	- Recall the debate about presidential regimes and democratic breakdown: large majority of these were military dictatorships previously

### Civilian Dictatorships

- Must create an institutional base for support
- Dominant-party:
	- One party regimes (like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union)
		- Members of the party turn into elites; become socialized into the system
	- Second longest-lived dictatorships
	- When encountering crises: grant moderate increases in political participation and representation for opposition
- Personalist dictatorships:
	- Still supported by a party/military, but the leader has more control (like in North Korea)

### Does the Type of Dictatorship Matter for Regime Change?

The probability of an authoritarian to democratic transition from a military dictatorship is greater than that from a civilian dictatorship, which is greater than that of a monarchical dictatorship.

### Why Are Some Authoritarian Regimes So Resilient?

Supporters of liberal democracy typically assume that most people don't want to live under authoritarian regimes...so why are there still so many?

A few different reasons:
- Brutal repression and inability to act collectively
- The "resource curse"
- "Competitive authoritarianism" and "democratic" mechanisms

### Collective Action

We've already discussed this in depth in the context of democratization

- There are dangers of opposing dictatorships
	- Citizens don't tend to reveal their true preferences (concealed preferences), preventing an information cascade
- Difficulty of knowing when other people (i.e. opposition to dictatorship) will organize with you
	- Remember the assurance game
- Some regimes especially repressive - threats of punishment deter any (or most) opposition

### Ross, Does Oil Hinder Democracy?

If oil does have antidemocratic effects, what is the causal mechanism?

- Rentier effect
	- Resource rich governments use low taxes and patronage to relieve pressures for greater accountability (e.g. public less likely to demand accountability and representation in government)
- Repression effect
	- Resource wealth stunts democratization by enabling governments to boost their funding for internal security
- Modernization effect
	- Growth based on the export of oil and minerals fails to bring about the social and cultural changes that tend to produce democratic government

### Caveats to the Resource Curse Hypothesis?

Waldner & Smith - Rethinking the Resource Curse (2021)

- Insofar as there is a political resource curse, it appears to be an overwhelmingly regional phenomenon restricted to the major oil-producing monarchies of the Arabian Peninsula
	- The small oil principalities along the eastern shore of the Arabian Peninsula represent instances of survivorship bias; after correcting for this bias, they fail to find evidence for a political resource curse
- With reference to temporal heterogeneity, they advance evidence that during the recent Third Wave of democratization, oil may very well be more of a blessing than a curse, as it appears to aid democratic consolidation in at least some parts of the world

### Brancati, "Democratic" Authoritarianism

In the past decade around 70% of authoritarian regimes have adopted legislative elections. Why?

- **Signaling**: using institutions to reveal the strength of the regime; elections are held and results are engineered to win. Creates an aura of invincibility by manufacturing large electoral victories.
- **Info acquisition**: identifying locations of supporters and opposition, learning about grievances before they become manifests as protests
- **Patronage distribution**: buying support form political elites and citizens. Political parties provide members with benefits and are more likely to oppose a coup.
- **Monitoring**: regime elites can monitor dictators, and vice versa.
- **Credible commitment**: democratic institutions allow authoritarian regimes to credibly commit to not expropriate domestic investment.

### "Democratic" Authoritarianism

- Dictatorships differ on their degree of competitiveness.
- A politically closed civilian dictatorship allows no opposition party to operate legally in the political arena.
- Electoral authoritarian regimes hold elections and tolerate some pluralism and inter-party competition but continue to violate minimal norms of democracy on a large scale such that opposition parties have no realistic opportunities to come to power.
	- Hegemonic electoral regime: the ruling party or party associated with the personalistic ruler routinely wins overwhelming and manufactured majorities.
	- Competitive electoral regime: opposition parties representing genuine preferences of subset of citizens win substantial minorities in presidential or parliamentary elections that have some degree of legality; but ruling party uses its control over state and economy to makes its victory almost foolproof.

### Levitsky and Way, The Rise of Competitive Authoritarianism

- Time to stop thinking about authoritarian regimes as incomplete or transitional forms of democracy, in contrast to modernization theory
- There are hybrid regimes, such as competitive authoritarianism
- Four arenas of electoral contestation:
	- Elections exist (still biased in media, harassment of opposition, lack of transparency)
	- Legislatures exist (though tend to be relatively weak, but may be focal points of opposition activity)
	- Judiciary exists (regimes subordinate this through bribery, extortion, etc.)
	- Independent media exists (but executive seeks to suppress)
- Nevertheless, authoritarian regimes adopt these measures of "contestation" for reasons that Brancati has already explained to us

### Problems of Explaining Autocratic Durability

Problem: too many theories, each with evidentiary support:
- Data is scarce
- Problem of inferring motives from outcomes
- Same institutions can have widely varying effects in different contexts
- Hard to generalize across regimes
- The most basic problem: dictators have too much freedom, difficult to explain behavior and outcomes in terms of either **constraints** or **optimization**

### Democratic Breakdown/Backsliding

...is unfortunately more common than we'd like to think
