### Defining Personality

### **Understanding Personality**

- No universally accepted definition of personality.
- Defined as a unique pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that persist over time and across situations.
- Personality traits are stable behaviors that explain individual responses to situations.
- Temperament (inborn behavioral predispositions) influences personality development.
- Three temperament types (Thomas & Chess, 1977):
    - **Easy children**: Positive responses, regular biological functions.
    - **Difficult children**: Irritable, negative reactions, irregular biological functions.
    - **Slow-to-warm-up children**: Mild reactions, adapt gradually to new situations.

### **Characteristics of Personality**

- **Universality & Uniqueness**: Everyone has a personality, but each is distinct.
- **Continuum of Traits**: Traits exist on a scale, varying in intensity.
- **Stability Over Time**: Personality remains consistent and predictable throughout life.
- **Affective Traits**: Emotional tendencies shape responses to different situations.
- **Nature vs. Nurture**:
    - Twin studies suggest personality is about **40% genetic and 60% environmental** (Vukasovic & Bratko, 2015).
    - Early research suggests childhood personality disorders have a genetic basis.

### **Assessing Personality**

- **Purpose**: Used in various fields (e.g., industrial, clinical, social psychology) to predict behavior and diagnose disorders.
- **Reliability & Validity**: A good personality test should provide consistent and accurate results.
- **Types of Personality Assessments**:
    1. **Personality Inventories (Objective Tests)**:
        - Use self-report questionnaires with numerical scales.
        - Examples: MMPI, NEO-PI-R (Big Five assessment).
    2. **Projective Tests**:
        - Assess unconscious thoughts by interpreting ambiguous stimuli.
        - Examples: Rorschach Inkblot Test, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).

### Models of Personality

#### **10.2.1.1. Freud’s Psychoanalysis**

    1. **Oral (0-2 yrs)** – Mouth-focused, fixation leads to argumentativeness.
    2. **Anal (2-3 yrs)** – Toilet training, fixation leads to messiness or excessive orderliness.
    3. **Phallic (3-6 yrs)** – Genital focus, Oedipus/Electra complex.
    4. **Latency (6-12 yrs)** – Dormant sexual impulses, same-sex friendships.
