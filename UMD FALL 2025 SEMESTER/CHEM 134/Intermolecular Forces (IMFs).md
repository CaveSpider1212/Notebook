### Dipole-Dipole

**Dipole-dipole**: Involves polar molecules with partial charges.

Dipoles point towards the molecule with greater electron density (giving it a partial negative charge, while the molecule it's pointing from gets a partial positive charge).

Factors affecting dipoles:
1. Electronegativity of atom (if between 0.4 and 2.0, then it is polar and has dipoles)
2. Geometry (linear molecules cancel out dipoles, making it nonpolar)

### Hydrogen Bonding

**Hydrogen bonds**: Special, stronger type of dipole-dipole force

In pure substances, the molecule must have a hydrogen (H) atom bonded to fluorine (F), oxygen (O), or nitrogen (N)

### Dispersion Forces

Present in all molecules/atoms, and is the weakest of the IMFs.

Factors affecting dispersion forces:
1. Polarizability: how easy to shift electron density and induce a dipole
	1. Larger atoms/molecules have higher polarizability
2. Size
	1. More compact atoms/molecules have weaker dispersion forces

### Ion-Dipole Forces

Partial charges interact with full charges (since full charges are involved, this is the strongest of the IMFs).
