### The Communication Process

- Nervous System:
	- Detection of environmental stimuli through 5 senses
	- Information transferred to the brain
	- Processing pathway:
		- Sensory memory --> Short-term memory
		- Thalamus --> Sensory cortex --> Amygdala (threat assessment)
		- Prefrontal cortex (decision making)

### Collecting and Assessing Information

- Definition: Process of gathering and evaluating information about others
- Sensory collection methods:
	- Visual cues (gestures, expressions)
	- Auditory information (speech, tone)
	- Other sensory inputs
- Information processing:
	- Raw data collection through sensation
	- Meaning attribution through perception
	- Storage in memory

### Attention

- Definition: ability to focus on specific environmental aspects
- Central Executive (Baddeley, 1996):
	- Controls attention focus
	- Directs attention to specific stimulus aspects
- Selective attention:
	- Voluntary focus on specific sensory inputs
	- Can shift based on interest and relevance

### Processing Capacity and Load

- Lavie's Load Theory:
	- **Processing capacity**: amount of information we can handle
	- **Perceptual load**: task difficulty level
	- Low-load tasks:
		- Use minimal cognitive resources
		- Allow attention to other stimuli
	- High-load tasks:
		- Consume more cognitive resources
		- Limit ability to process additional stimuli

### Types of Attentional Blindness

- **Inattentional blindness**: missing visible stimuli when focused on a task
	- Example: the Invisible Gorilla experiment
- **Repetition blindness**: difficulty perceiving rapidly repeated stimuli
	- Occurs with both numbers and letters
- **Change blindness**: difficulty noticing changes between rapidly successive images
	- More pronounced in peripheral vision

### Can We Multitask?

- Possible with well-practiced tasks
- Effectiveness decreases with task difficulty
- Risk factors:
	- Overconfidence in multitasking ability
	- Underestimation of personal vulnerability
	- Example: Dangers of texting while driving

### Attention and Learning

- Essential for all learning models:
	- Required for observational learning
	- Crucial for conditioning (classical and operant)
	- Necessary for processing reinforcement
- Practical applications:
	- Classroom learning
	- Workplace training
	- Skill acquisition

### What is memory?

- **Encoding**: translating sensory information into a form that can be used and retained in the memory system
- **Storage**: retention of information for later use
- **Retrieval**: bringing stored information into conscious awareness

### Stages of Memory

- **Sensory memory**: attends to volumes of sensory info for very brief periods of time (e.g. matter of seconds)
	- Actually collected as "snapshots" that are overlapped
- **Short-term memory**: limited information storage
	- Duration: 15-20 seconds
- **Long-term memory**: extensive information storage
	- Duration: indefinite, potentially decades

#### Sensory Memory

- Types and Characteristics
	- Near unlimited capacity
	- Rapid information fade
- Two main registers:
	- Iconic (Visual):
		- Duration: ~1/4 second
		- "Eye-conic" memory aid
		- Rapid masking process
	- Echoic (Auditory):
		- Duration: 1-2 seconds
		- Think "echo" for sound
		- Longer duration than iconic

#### Short-term Memory

- Characteristics and Capacity
	- Duration: 15-20 seconds
	- Capacity: 7 $\pm$ 2 items (Miller, 1956)
		- Updated research: 4 $\pm$ 2 items
- Chunking Strategy
	- Breaking large information into meaningful units
	- Example: Grouping states by region
	- Makes information more manageable

##### Attention and Filtering

- Broadbent's Filtering Theory
	- Attention as an on-off switch
	- Limited by inability to explain cocktail party effect
- Treisman's Modified Filtering Theory:
	- Attention as volume control
	- Explains selective attention
	- Accounts for cocktail party effect

#### Long- Term Memory

- Indefniite storage duration 
- Implicit (nondeclarative);
	- Based on prior experience
	- Procedural memories
	- Example: Riding a bike
- Explicit (declarative):
	- Semantic memory: Facts and concepts
	- Episodic Memory: Personal Experiences
	- Must be consciously recalled

##### Types of Explicit Memory

- **Explicit memories** (or declarative memory) are memories that address consciously
	- **Semantic memory**: language and knowledge about language (i.e. What is an action potential?)
	- **Episodic memory**: events we have personally experienced (i.e. What did you do for your lost birthday?)
		- **Flashbulb memories**: highly detailed and exceptionally vivid episodic memory
			- People are often very confident in the precision of the memory
			- Prone to errors of memory

##### Types of Implicit Memory

- **Implicit memories** are not part of consciousness
	- Formed from <u>behaviors</u> (thinking, conditioning, and latent learning)
		- **Repetition priming**: repeated encounters with material make later processing easier
	- **Procedural memory**: "muscle memory"
	- **Emotional conditioning**: retention of classically conditioned emotional relationships that cannot be voluntarily recollected or reported
		- Leads to **illusion-of-truth effect**

### Organization of Information

- **Clustering**: similar pieces of information are grouped together to form categories
	- Using clusters enhances memory
	- Even if list is present randomly, people tend to cluster information
		- In comparing people who do and do not cluster, cluster-ers do betters
		- **Hard clustering**: distinct qualities (i.e. it is either fruit or it isn't)
		- **Hierarchical clustering**: small groups form into larger groups

### Retrieval Cues

- Memory is not stored in a <u>chronological fashion</u>
	- We can remember childhood memories sometimes easier than remembering what we did an hour ago
- **Retrieval cues**: stimuli which prompt attention to memories
- Efficient retrieval cues are those which reliably "call-up" the desired memory
- Many memory "errors" are due to issues with retrieval cues
	- Tip-of-the-tongue experience

### Using Memories

- **Recall**: retrieving a memory without a cue
	- Essay tests
- **Recognition**: identifying if new information is consistent with previously learned information or not
	- Multiple choice tests
- **Relearning**: re-encountering previously learning information
- **Hyperthymesia** (aka **highly superior autobiographical memory** or HSAM): able to remember events from their lives with an incredibly high level of detail

### Enhancing Recall

- When conditions for recall are similar to conditions during initial memory acquisition, retrieval is more likely to succeed
	- Matching mental/emotional states with when you learned the information will be helpful
- Mnemonic Devices
	- "Every Good Boy Does Fine"
	- PEMDAS

### Amnesia

- **Amnesia**: memory loss
	- **Retrograde Amnesia**: forgetting things before an event (e.g. TBI, surgery)
	- **Anterograde Amnesia**: impairment forming new memories
- H.M. had portions of his temporal lobes removed, including hippocampus
	- Was unable to form new episodic or semantic memories
	- Had some residual declarative knowledge (famous people)
	- Retained capacity for procedural memories, but did not remember learning new motor actions

### Eyewitness Misidentification

- Work of Elizabeth Loftus shows us that, despite the confidence one may have in their memories, they may not be very accurate (**Misinformation Effect**)
	- Implication for both criminal justice system and treatment of individuals who experience traumatic events

### Repressed Memories

- **Repression**: unconscious dismissal of a memory from conscious experience
	- Originated with Freud
- Techniques such as hypnotism used to "recover" lost memories
- Many high-profile individuals remembering horrific traumatic experiences that never happened

##### Schacter's Seven Sins of Memory

- Transience
	- Type: Forgetting
	- Description: Accessibility of memory decreases over time
	- Example: Forget events that occurred long ago
- Absentmindedness
	- Type: Forgetting
	- Description: Forgetting caused by lapses in attention
	- Example: Forget where your phone is
- Blocking
	- Type: Forgetting
	- Description: Accessibility of information is temporarily blocked
	- Example: Tip of the tongue
- Misattribution
	- Type: Distortion
	- Description: Source of memory is confused
	- Example: Recalling a dream memory as a walking memory
- Suggestibility
	- Type: Distortion
	- Description: False memories
	- Example: Result from leading questions
- Bias
	- Type: Distortion
	- Description: Memories distorted by current belief system
	- Example: Align memories to current beliefs
- Persistence
	- Type: Intrusion
	- Description: Inability to forget undesirable memories
	- Example: Traumatic events
