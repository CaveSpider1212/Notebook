### Faraday's Experiments (1831)

![[3.17.25 Faraday's Experiments.png]]

> [!info]
> A charging magnetic field in the loop induces a current.

### Motional emf

> ![[3.17.25 Motional emf.png]]
> 
> $\vec{F}_{mag} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$
> $F_E = F_B$
> $qE = qvB\sin\theta$ <--- $\theta = 90\degree$ because the velocity and magnetic field vectors make a $90\degree$ angle
> $E = vB$
> 
> The motional emf is:
> $\epsilon = \Delta V = E l = vlB$

> [!tip] Motional emf
> $$\epsilon = \Delta V = El = vlB$$

### Induced Current

> By Ohm's Law
> $I = \frac{\epsilon}{R} = \frac{v l B}{R}$
> 
> The force of the pull:
> $F_{pull} = F_{mag} = IlB\sin\theta = \frac{v l B}{R}lB = \frac{v l^2 B^2}{R}$
> 
> The power exerted by the pull is:
> $P_{pull} = F_{pull} v = \frac{v^2 l^2 B^2}{R}$
> 
> The power dissipated by the resistor is:
> $P_{diss} = I^2 R = \frac{v^2 l^2 B^2}{R}$

### Eddy Currents

> [!info]
> There is a net force on the magnet opposite the direction of motion ($\vec{v}$).

### Magnetic Flux

$\Phi_M = \int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}$

> [!info] Magnetic Flux
> For uniform magnetic fields:
> $$\Phi_m = \vec{B} \cdot \int d \vec{A} = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}$$
> 
> $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic field and the axis of the loop
> 
> SI unit: Weber (1 Weber = 1 Wb = 1 Tm^2)

> [!example]
> If the magnetic field inside a solenoid with radius 1.0 cm is 0.20 T, what is the magnetic flux through the wire loop, which has a radius of 20 cm (solenoid goes through the loop)?
> 
> $\Phi_m = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} = (0.20)(\pi (0.01)^2) =$ 6.3 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ Wb
> 
> Now, the loop is tilted at a 60$\degree$ angle. What is the magnetic flux through the loop?
> 
> $\Phi_m =$ 6.3 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ Wb
