### The Elements of Cognition

- **Cognition**: thinking
	- Includes processes like [[Learning and Behaviorism]], attention and [[Memory]], reasoning, decision making, and problem solving, and language
	- Consists of concepts, schemas, propositions, and images
- **Concepts**: mental categories of objects, ideas, abstractions, event, relations, or activities that have common properties and are shared by all members of the category
	- **Formal concepts**: more rigid and defined
		- Example: a square always has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles
	- **Natural concepts**: only have a typical set of characteristics
		- Example: birds have wings, so they should be able to fly, but penguins have wings but can't necessarily fly
		- **Prototype**: member that shares most of the characteristic features
- **Proposition**: unit of meaning that are composed of concepts and express a relationship between the concepts
- **Schema**: organized way of making sense of experience
	- **Role schema**: how people carrying out certain roles or jobs are to act
		- Example: role of HR, cashier, etc.
	- **Person schema**: beliefs and expectations about what the personality of certain types of people is like and how they are to behave in various situations
		- Example: firefighters, geeks, jocks, etc. expected to behave a certain way
	- **Event schema** or **script**: what is to occur in certain situations
		- Example: what usually happens in a party, chemistry lab, etc.
	- These make cognitive processing move quicker, and also complete incomplete pictures in terms of what we know about someone
- **Mental images**: pictures in the mind's eye
- **Subconscious thinking**: mental functioning that occurs outside of conscious awareness
	- Affords us the ability to process more information and to complete more tasks than we would be able to if processed consciously
	- Example: we can drive a car without thinking (not safe)
- **Nonconscious thinking**: occurs when we learn something without being aware we knew it or were learning it
	- *Latent learning*: learning that is not immediately expressed in overt behavior ([[Learning and Behaviorism#^e9c8ed]])
	- *Insight learning*: occurs spontaneously due to understanding all parts of a problem ^ba5da5

### Problem-Solving: When we Seek Solutions

- **Problems**: when we cannot achieve a goal due to an obstacle that we are unsure how to overcome
	- At times, the answer to the problem just comes to us suddenly, called insight learning ([[Cognition & Intelligence#^ba5da5]])
- **Functional fixedness**: when we focus on a typical use or familiar function of an object
	- Obstacle to problem-solving
- **Divergent thinking**: thinking that involves more than one possible solution and that is open-ended

### Reasoning: Making Good Decisions, and Learning from Them

- **Reasoning**: process of formulating and evaluating arguments so we can draw inferences or conclusions about them
	- **Formal/deductive reasoning**: used when the procedure needed to draw a conclusion is clear and only one answer is possible
		- Makes use of **algorithms**, or a logical sequence of steps that always produces a correct solution to the problem
	- **Informal/inductive reasoning**: used when there is no single correct solution to a problem, and a conclusion may not follow from premises or facts
		- Uses **dialectical reasoning**, or comparison of differing viewpoints to resolve discrepancies
- **Heuristics**: using past experiences as a guide or shortcut to make decisions quickly (work well, but aren't fool proof)
	- *Availability heuristic*: used when we make estimates about how often an event occurs based on how easily we can remember examples
	- *Representative heuristic*: believing something comes from a larger category based on how well it represents the properties of the category
	- *Affect heuristic*: thinking with our heart and not our head
	- *Hindsight bias*: we sometimes tend to look back over past events and claim we knew the errors in reasoning all along
	- *Confirmation*: occurs when we seek information and arrive at conclusions that confirm our existing beliefs
	- *Mental set*: when we attempt to solve a problem using what worked well in the past

### Intelligence -- Putting Our Learning to Good Use

- **Intelligence**: ability to solve problems, acquire language and knowledge, think abstractly, adapt to one's environment, and engage in the manipulation of one's environment
	- **Crystalized intelligence**: accumulated knowledge across life
	- **Fluid intelligence**: used when we solve problems, remember information, and reason abstractly
	- **Intelligence quotient (IQ) test**: measure of intelligence, found by dividing child's mental age by their chronological age and multiplying by 100
- Sternberg proposed his **triarchic theory of intelligence** which says there are three different types of intelligence
	- **Componential (analytic) intelligence**: measured by traditional intelligence tests and aids you in solving problems by first identifying it, deciding on a strategy to solve it, learning and then executing the strategy, and finally evaluating the result of your strategy
	- **Creative (experiential) intelligence**: type of intelligence used to compose music
		- People with this ability cope with new situations well and learn quickly
	- **Practical (contextual) intelligence**: ability to adapt to your environment or to consider the different contexts you may find yourself in
- Howard Gardner proposed the existence of several intelligences, each of which involve a different set of skills and which can function independently of one another
	- Include linguistic (verbal skills), logical-mathematical (math and reasoning skills), and spatial (relationship between objects) intelligences, which are the only ones tested by standard IQ tests
	- Also includes musical (shown in tempo/rhythm), body-kinesthetic (dancing/athletic skills), intrapersonal (self-understanding), interpersonal (interacting with others), and naturalistic (seeing patterns in nature) intelligences
- **Emotional intelligence (EI)**: ability to manage the emotions of others as well as ourselves
	- Includes skills like empathy, emotional awareness, managing emotions, and self-control
	- These skills fall under *personal competence* (individual/self-awareness) and *social competence* (relationships with others)

### Learning Disabilities

> [!tip] Key Takeaways
> - Intellectual developmental disorder is characterized by intellectual functioning (Criterion A) and adaptive functioning (Criterion B) deficits and they must occur during the developmental period.
> - Specifiers for intellectual developmental disorder indicate severity – mild, moderate, severe, or profound.
> - A specific learning disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties learning critical academic skills during the years of formal schooling such as reading of single words accurately and fluently or arithmetic calculation; performance of the affected academic skills being well below expected for age; learning difficulties being apparent in the early school years for most individuals, and that the learning difficulties are considered “specific” (for four reasons).
> - Treatment options for intellectual developmental disorder include community supports and programs, educational interventions such as IEPs, and psychotherapy.
> - Treatment options for specific learning disorder include educational interventions such as IEPs and tutoring.
> - Medicine is not utilized to ‘treat’ either disorder, but to manage emotional or behavioral concerns that are occurring comorbid with the two disorders.
