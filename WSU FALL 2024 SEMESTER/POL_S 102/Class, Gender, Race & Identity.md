### Political Identity

The way that individuals categorize themselves and others, and how they understand the power relationships of domination and oppression that exist between groups.

Two major thinkers on the sources of political identity:
- **Karl Marx**: one's **economic position in society** is the primary way in which people think about individual and collective political identity.
- **Max Weber**: identity is primarily noneconomic in origin, formed primarily among groups of people who share **an understanding of a common heritage** based on religion, race, or the related concept of ethnicity, language, territory, or family ties.

<u>Warning</u>: discussing political identity is *not* necessarily the same thing as discussing Identity (note the capital I!) politics as a theory.

### Marx, Materialism, and Class-consciousness

- The **class cleavage** arises during the **industrial revolution**; then spreads throughout the world
	- Mutates and evolves into different forms e.g. Marxism-Leninism
- Workers and bourgeoisie form identities around these economic interests
	- i.e. their interests are based on **economic material conditions**
	- Recall the materialist vs. postmaterialist divide
- Marx **acknowledges other forms of oppression**, especially women's oppression and horrors of colonization and racism
	- "Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex"
- But ultimately, **capitalism and economic interests are source of identity**, conflict, and oppression
	- All other identities are mere distractions from the bigger problem (the class divide)

### Weber and Cultural Identity

- Rooted more in **cultural beliefs and symbols**
	- e.g. the markers (food, flags, music, art, phrases, dress, etc.) of cultures, ethnicities, groups
- His argument focuses on ethnicity and religion to start
	- The theory has branched out since then, and now encompasses a variety of different possible identities
- So, according to this argument, one group of people - along ethnic lines, for example - would be more likely to behave/vote a certain way
	- Regardless of class/economic background
- Of course, this differs from context to context: compare the UK to India

### Summarizing the Arguments

- On the one hand: **economic interests are fixed; an immutable reality**
	- Sure, you may "better" yourself and get a higher-paying job, OR lose wealth
	- But you can't identify out of your own income bracket!
	- Culture can play a role, but ultimately it is the economic, material conditions that shape that culture
- On the other hand: **identity is cultural and crosses economic and material conditions**
	- The construction of symbols, social cues, mannerisms, etc. is primary
- Recall arguments about post-materialism
	- Shift from traditional, material values to secular-rational and self-expression values

### What is Primordialism?

- Primordial thinking about identity asserts that:
	- Identity is rooted in human nature or at least is the subject of fundamental and intense attachment/aversion that is relatively resistant to change.
	- Identity produces deeply rooted affective ties that are fixed, immutable, inherently linked to conflict, given and natural.
	- Identities are a fundamental and durable form of affiliation characterized by intense feelings.
		- It is an end in and of itself because it satisfies the human need for community
- Identity is usually treated as the independent variable by primordialists - i.e. as the treatment or explanation
	- It is a phenomenon rather than an epiphenomenon

### Primordialism's Strengths & Weaknesses

- Strengths
	- May help explain:
		- The intensity and durability of ethnic affiliation and the sentiments that frequently flow from them: affection, hatred, and willingness to sacrifice
		- How political actors see identity
- Weaknesses
	- Neglects changes in identity content, salience, and mobilization
	- Little insight into when or how identities translate into political organizing and action in some cases and not others
	- Can't explain variation, especially in degree and kind of conflict
	- Can't explain new identities or conflicts

### What is Constructivism?

- Identity is shaped and given meaning by social, structural forces including discourse, frames, symbols, social practices, institutions, power dynamics and more.
- It is "constructed" and not a given. This construction determines an identity's content, boundaries, and relation to other identities
- It clearly acknowledges how endogeneity is involved in identity formation
	- The state helps create identities and reifies them
	- Individuals internalize them

### Constructivism's Strengths & Weaknesses

- Strengths
	- Better able to explain cross-national variation in emergence and salience of political identity because it allows individuals to choose and consciously attach political significance to identity
	- Better able to explain cross-national variation in emergence and salience of political identity because it focuses on how the socio-political context shapes, constraints, and constructs individual choices.
- Weaknesses
	- Unable to make sense of the way most people perceive their own identities
	- Difficult to identity the precise mechanism by which identity becomes politically salient for millions of people and is transmitted from one generation to the next

### How Does Identity Become Politicized?

Primordialists don't give us a lot of answers to this question.

Constructivist argument
- Long-term social, economic, or technological change.
- Because someone or some group had an interest in that outcome

### Different Ways of Thinking of Representation

- Descriptive
	- Whether representatives resemble their constituents along various identities
	- Assumption is members of those groups share policy preferences
- Symbolic
	- Implies that a representative symbolizes a constituency (Stokke & Selboe 2009)
		- Monarchs symbolizing a nation
		- Different from descriptive, which says representative bodies should reflect the composition of people who are being represented
- Substantive
	- Whether representative take actions in line with the substantive and ideological interests of those they represent

### The Politics of Gender

Gender as a category:
- A form of socially constructed political identity that considers variation in the social meaning of masculinity and femininity around the world.

Gender as a process (Beckwith 2005)
- The differential effects of structures and policies upon women and men.
- The means by which masculine and feminine actors (often men and women, but not perfectly congruent, and often individuals but also structures) actively work to produce favorable gendered outcomes.

### Hunt: Is Gender Like Ethnicity?

Candidate quotas for cross cutting groups; seat reservations for coinciding
- Candidate quotas are more appropriate for groups that crosscut partisan cleavages, while reservations suit groups that coincide with them
- Gender identities tend to cut across parties, whereas ethnic identities often overlap with partisan affiliations
- Consequently, disadvantaged groups that are defined by gender demand, and are granted, candidate quotas; ethnic groups prefer, and receive, legislative reservations

- Candidate quotas intervene in party nomination procedures by requiring that a certain percentage of the candidates fielded by a party be of a certain group
- Seat reservations, by contrast, guarantee group members a share of power independently, if need be, of existing parties
	- Separate electoral rolls, special electoral districts that limit competition to group members, exceptions to counting rules, and provisions for direct appointment to the legislature.
