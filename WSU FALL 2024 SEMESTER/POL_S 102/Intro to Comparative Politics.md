- Normative claims: based on bias and opinion
- Aesthetic claims:
  - Subjective - what we think?
  - Empirical - facts?
  - Descriptive

- Confirmation bias: you see what you want to see

- We as humans are prone to systematic errors in the way we see the world
  - Due to features of our cognitive systems, and that we often make opinions on ambiguous or unclear data

- The primary principle of studying politics is attempting to falsify our hypotheses not to confirm them

- We need systematic methods, methods for collecting data, methods for analyzing data

- Our something is based on the credibility of the methods and how they were gathered
  - Trust experts because they follow the appropriate methods and hold their work to a high standard

#### Comparative Politics:

  - Comparative politics is NOT...
    - Reviewing countries one by one (we want to remain broad and open-minded)
- Comparative politics IS...
  - Comparison and contrast of countries' domestic political affairs
  - Basically everything outside of the US (in the US context)

- Three theories
  - Political culture: culture is associated with political outcomes
  - Political institutions: institutions are associated with political outcomes
  - Political economy: economic interests are associated with political outcomes

- There is usually a mix of things going on in the world, but we want our explanations to be coherent and try to accurately describe what's happening

##### Political Culture

- Norms, values, beliefs, religion affect political outcomes


##### Political Institutions

- Presidential vs. parliamentary systems
- Electoral systems
  - Majoritarian vs. proportional representation
  - Accountable vs. representative politics
- Political parties
  - Number of them and their size
  - How organized they are
  - Programmatic vs. personalistic

##### Political economy

- Economic interests
  - Self-interested actors ("rational")


#### State Formation

- The nation state and borders are not self-evident
  - Origins
  - Start by looking at Europe
    - Had a lot of decentralized kingdoms
    - Became more centralized over time culturally and politically
    - Post-colonial states
  - Did not have the same trajectory, had "stunted growth" since Europe got there first

#### Social Movements and Protest Politics

- Why form social movements?
  - Goals? How cohesive/successful are they? Reason for protest, and time?

#### Democracies and Authoritarian Regimes

- What does it mean to be a democracy? How do we observe and measure it?
- What is an authoritarian regime?
- What are the variations? How have they evolved over time? Is authoritarianism to democracy really a linear, one-way process? How may the two be "mixed?"

#### Identity: Class, Race, Gender, and More

- Class
  - Explored through economic interests
- Race and gender
  - How are identities constructed?
  - How are power structures built?
  - How does this affect political outcomes?
    - Power struggles, individual agency, group identity
    - Materialism vs. ideas

#### Ethnic Conflict and Civil Wars

- Why and how do civil wars occur?
  - Economic interests (like seizing different resources)
    - Opportunities
  - Political culture (differences)
- Ethnic conflict
  - What is ethnic conflict, and how may it affect political outcomes?
