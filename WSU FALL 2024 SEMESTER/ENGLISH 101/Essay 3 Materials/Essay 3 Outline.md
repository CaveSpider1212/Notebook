Source Notes: [[Essay 3 Source Notes]]
ADD POPULAR SOURCE!

- Intro paragraph
	- Communication needed in engineering (specifically in English)
	- Maybe mention technical terms also needed (jargon) but some people may not be able to get the knowledge of these terms
	- Also, some people (especially those in foreign countries) may not exactly have the proper training of English to be used in the workplace which could affect their job performance
	- Aiming to answer the role language plays in academic and job success in engineering, which I define as achieving "power"
	- Argument: Knowing English ("language") plays a big role in finding academic and professional success in engineering ("power")
		- Adding on: people in foreign countries, as English isn't their first language, may find it harder to truly achieve power due to their limited opportunities in learning English, the engineering lingua franca
- Scholarly source (English Language Needs Iran)
	- Talk about this source
	- Knowing English increases chances for engineers to get jobs ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^169721]])
	- Knowing English allows engineers to present better, as many presentations are given in English ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^d23835]])
	- Knowing English also allows engineers to properly understand official job-related documents ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^f802dc]])
- Scholarly source (Maximizing Diversity)
	- Talk about source
	- While language diversity is important for a multicultural workplace, it can create language barriers impacting team productivity, and engineering workplaces can also be affected ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^bf0735]])
	- Mention how study in the article confirms the earlier theory ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^acfcf2]])
- Scholarly source (Transnational Technical Communication)
	- Talk about source
	- Talk about BELF ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^6cb943]])
	- Connect idea of BELF to engineering workplaces in Qatar ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^1d6349]])
	- The audience is more likely to use BELF instead of the engineers' native language, so that's why engineers typically use English in real life, and that's why all engineers should do the same ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^9f5d0c]])
	- Engineers learn technical terms in English, so it would be much easier to use English to communicate those terms, which is why engineers should use English in the workplace ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^42adb4]])
		- Maybe move to paragraph about jargon if I make one
- Counterarguments
	- Scholarly source (Affordances of Engineering)
		- Talk about source
		- Source claims engineering benefits from having people learning English, so it may imply that fluency in English isn't as necessary for engineers to achieve "power" as other sources may claim ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^33229d]])
		- Engineering actually provides opportunities (talk about affordances?) to English learners in the field, as there are many things in engineering that depend on their diverse knowledge, explaining why many people learning English gravitate towards engineering, which shows that it may not be as necessary to be fluent in English for engineers to achieve "power" ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^6dcf09]])
			- Rebuttal (for both): It does also say that students in engineering programs that are also learning English may find it harder to learn the technical terms since it may be too complicated ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^cad865]])
				- Jargon?
	- Scholarly source (Transnational Technical Communication)
		- Using BELF in the workplace may diminish the cultural identity of engineers in a way ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^0e7b09]])
			- Rebuttal: Achieving "power" in engineering has nothing to do with cultural engineering, so my point still stands (using English or BELF gives engineers academic and job success, or "power")
	- Scholarly source (Perspectives from Turkish Engineers)
		- Talk about source
		- Mention that it argues similar things to the Iran source, but includes a few counterarguments
		- Being proficient in English may not be enough to be successful in engineering ([[Essay 3 Source Notes#^67156f]])
			- Rebuttal: Source does still say that engineers must be competent in workplace communication tasks in English, so it still proves English ("language") is very important in academic and job success ("power") for engineers
- Conclusion paragraph
	- Restate arguments
	- State why topic is important (foreign engineering programs should properly teach English to foreign engineering students to better prepare them for the language requirements of the job)
