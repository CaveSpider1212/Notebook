#### Algorithms

- **Algorithm**: sequence of instructions that solve a problem, allowing us to automate the solution and repeat the solution to a problem, and also halts the result in a finite amount of time

- Algorithm contents
  - Sequenced instructions (order)
  - Conditional instructions (do if condition is true)
  - Iterative instructions (do while condition is true)

#### Programming Languages

- **Low-level languages** involve more binary and were made from the perspective of the machine and are designed to interact with them more
  - Machine language and Assembly are examples
- **High-level languages** have more natural language (English, Spanish, etc.) elements
  - Programming language like Python, C++, etc. are examples

#### Compilers and IDEs

- Computers can't understand English seen in high-level programming languages, so they must be "translated" to machine language instructions
  - **Compiler**: translates a source file into machine language instructions (makes sure the file is correct first, and then translates)
    - Linker programs perform this operations
    - Loader programs loads the linked program into memory so it can be executed
- **IDEs** (integrated development environments) combine compilers, linkers, and loaders with a source code editor, and allow us to use all of these by pressing a button, and they also provide other useful features

#### Software Development Method

- The software development method is almost equivalent to the scientific method
  1. Specify problem requirements
  2. Analyze the problem
  3. Design an algorithm to solve the problem
  4. Implement the algorithm
  5. Test and verify the completed program
  6. Maintain and update the program
