### Terms

**Developmental Psychology**: study of patterns of growth, stability, and change during the lifespan

- Growth: movement from simple to complex/maturing
- Stability: period when growth is complete and abilities peak
- Change: later decline as body shows signs of wear and tear
	- Primary aging: natural age-related changes
	- Secondary aging: changes affected by behavior and environment

### Developmental Periods

1. Infancy/Toddlerhood (birth-3 years)
2. Preschool Years (3-6 years)
3. Middle Childhood (6-12 years)
4. Adolescence (12-20 years)
5. Early Adulthood (20-40 years)
6. Middle Adulthood (40-65 years)
7. Late Adulthood (65+ years)

### Types of Development

- Physical development: body changes and how they affect behavior
- Cognitive development: changes in intellectual abilities
- Social/personality development: social interactions and personality changes

### Principles of Development

- Cephalocaudal principle: Development proceeds from head to toe
	- Your nervous system develops before you can walk or run
- Proximodistal principle: Development proceeds from near to far
	- Development of gross and fine motor skills
- Hierarchical integration: Development goes from simple to complex
	- Before you can pick up objects with your hands, you must learn to control individual fingers
- Independence of systems: Different bodily systems develop at different rates

### Infancy - Physical Development

- Brain development and efficiency
	- Synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning
- Reflexes and their adaptive function
- Sensory systems development
	- Touch, taste, smell, hearing, vision
- Depth perception (visual cliff experiment)
- Motor skill development
	- Gross motor vs. fine motor skills

### Infancy - Cognitive Development

- Piaget's Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years) -- Six substages
	1. Reflexes
	2. Primary circular reactions
	3. Secondary circular reactions
	4. Coordination of secondary schemas
	5. Tertiary circular reactions
	6. Mental representation
- Object permanence
- Language development
	- Prelinguistic communication
	- Babbling
	- First words and sentences
	- Motherese (infant-directed speech)
