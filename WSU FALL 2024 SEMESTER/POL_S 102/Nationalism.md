### Causal Heterogeneity

- Transitions in one part of the world may preclude parallel transitions in other parts of the world at other points in time.
	- The conditions that produced European political and economic power were unique and large non-replicable
	- Once Europe emerges as a global hegemon, the conditions for all other political units were indelibly altered, such that they could not follow the European trajectory.
- Theories of development must be historically specific: the role of the state in the transition to capitalism in Europe was different from the role of the state in late development.

### Three Questions About Transitions to Democracy

1. What explains the transition to mass-participatory politics that occurred prior to the mergence of the first democracies?
2. What explains the initial origins of democracy in specific global regions in the nineteenth century?
3. What explains the subsequent incremental and discontinuous spread of democracy around the globe in the twentieth century?

### Our Initial Hunch

The rise of the modern bureaucratic state and the subsequent emergence of capitalism both contributed to mass politics and the initial origins of capitalism.

The uneven distribution of state power around the globe and the uneven capacity for wealth production that follows explains the incremental and discontinuous spread of democracy around the globe in the twentieth century.

### Nations and Nationalism

- We live in a world populated by groups of people who define their common identity with respect to a state -- roughly speaking, "nations"
- A central political idea over the past 150-200 years is the claim that the borders of the nation and the borders of the state should be congruent.
- This ideas shapes our identities: we define ourselves as citizens of the nation to which we belong.
- We attach the rights and obligations of citizenship to members of the nation and deny them to non-members.

### Three Common Claims about Nations & Nationalism

- Nations exist from time immemorial -- rooted in "primordial" identities
- Ancient national cultures were relatively homogeneous
- Ancient national cultures were linguistically uniform

#### Why these claims are myths

- Pre-modern European polities were hierarchically stratified with heterogeneous rights and obligations attached to each of three orders (nobility, clergy, burghers).
	- This type of heterogeneity was common in systems of indirect rule and would persist around the world until the French Revolution initiated the age of citizenship and republics.
- Legal/administrative heterogeneity was accompanied by cultural heterogeneity
- Linguistic diversity: liturgical and court languages, localized vernaculars.
- Rulers had neither the desire nor the capacity to elicit cultural uniformity.
- Rulers claimed divine right to rule, not mass-based legitimacy.

#### Why these myths matter

- The myths, were they true, would be sufficient to establish the *exogeneity* of cultural identities and would even suggest that cultural identities shape politics and perhaps even economics.
- If the myths are not true, then cultural identities must have changed over time; and it is quite likely that they are *endogenous* to something else.
- They could be endogenous to economic change and the rise of capitalism.
- They could also be endogenous to the rise of the modern state.

### The Problem of Asymmetric Information (Again)

Rulers wish to extract wealth and manpower: but they do not know how much of these resources exist and who controls them.

Rulers dispatch agents to the local level:
- Even local agents have difficulty gaining access to local information
- Local agents have incentives to exploit information asymmetries

### Origins of European Nationalism: Legibility

- Alongside of plunder and bargaining, European states worked hard to render their societies more *legible*: gain access to more information
- Pre-modern societies were highly *particularistic* - based on local languages, local practices, local units of measure -- and hence illegible to outsiders.
- Local particularism insulates communities from state power
- Projects of legibility: **create standardized categories and measures and apply uniformly to the entire population**: reduce the costs of acquiring information
- Standardization and legibility would have been unthinkable to rulers with low infrastructural power: would not have had the capacity

### Projects of Legibility: Measures and Land

- Systems of measurement
- Measuring land
- Assigning land to individuals
- Naming individuals
- Reducing cultural heterogeneity

##### Measures

Feudal rents paid in *bushels*. Bushels were customary unit of measure that did not distinguish between volume and mass.

- Feudal lords wished to extract rents in a large basket, pay wages in a small basket.
- Size of basket could be affected by bulge of base, thickness of rim, tricks of weaving, etc.
- Efforts at local standardization--carve standardized bushel from stone, store in church.
- Compared to metric system: one weight, one measure, applied to entire kingdom: requires enormous levels of infrastructural power.

##### Land

- Right to collect taxes from land are distributed among overlapping lines of authority.
- Customary use of land differs from village to village
- Boundaries maintained by "beating the bounds." Dual meaning of physically creating the boundary but also creating local collective memory of boundaries.
- Usufruct over plots of land distributed among households by size of household, periodically adjusted.
- Trees and grazing area are common, with local rules and regulations.
- No single person "owns" the land.

### Infrastructural Power and Private Ownership of Land

(in this order)
1. Begin with standardized system of measurement
2. Conduct cadastral survey (process to redefine boundaries) to establish fixed boundaries: combination of principles of spatial measurement with knowledge of legal principles
3. Registration of boundaries
4. Annual assessment of property value
5. Annual collection of taxes
6. Police force to enforce property rights and judicial system to adjudicate disputes

### Projects of Legibility: Individuals, Language, & National Cultures

People: from customary patronymic names to universal fixed surnames.

In around 1100, there was an imposition of a single, official language, replacing French as the trans-Europe language of elites, and local dialects...teachers as state and nation builders.

Statistics = state + surveillance. Mathematical manipulation of new source of information: the census.

Mid-19th century: Invention of *'l'homme type'* and therefore invention of 'national cultures.' What we view as existing from time immemorial was recently invented.

### State Building

- Projects of legibility require substantial reservoirs of infrastructural power: state building had to predate the emergence of nations.
- Increasing resources/capacities --> Increasing weight of the state over society & --> Increasing territorial uniformity in reach of the state.

### Unintended Consequences of State Building

- Prior to state building, political authority is locally circumscribed: with few exceptions, all politics was local politics, and all commerce was local as well.
- Therefore, people had no reason to identify with political bodies outside their local environment.
- But with projects of legibility and new burdens placed on local communities by voracious rulers, politics slowly became 'nationalized.'
- Nations are relatively modern constructions: they are the ideational concomitant of this slow political development.

### Nations

**Nation**: a community of people who recognize themselves as culturally distinct from other groups due to:
- Common cultural practices, beliefs, institutions, language, but also ethnicity or religion
- Common homeland
- Sense of shared, formative history
- Common destiny

### Nationalism

- Ideology that claims that a nation can achieve its common destiny only through mass co-operation via sovereign political institutions.
- Two corollaries:
	- The borders of the state should be congruent with the borders of the nation
	- The state must represent the interests of the nations, not the interests of the ruler or dynasty or ruling class or any other particular group.

### Varieties of Nationalism

Initially, nationalism is a product of state building; over time, the idea of nationalism spreads beyond western Europe to entirely different polities. Nationalism can be imported from abroad, but is altered in the process:
- Demand to alter territorial boundaries of multi-ethnic empires to include or exclude particular groups
- Demand from specific groups for independence from multi-ethnic empires
- Demand to build a state that has the capacity to defend the nation

### From Nationalism to Citizenship

- By breaking down the idea that subjects of the ruler had distinct privileges and obligations based upon their station of birth, nationalism created the potential for a new relationship between rulers and the ruled: **citizens and citizenship**
- **Citizen**: new category of identity and persons defined exclusively by their legal attachment to the state.
- **Citizenship**: set of enforceable rights and obligations *shared uniformly among members of the nation*, creates ideas about political equality, paving way for eventual democratic transitions.
