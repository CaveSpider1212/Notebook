### Person Perception

- **Social cognition**: study of the process of collecting and assessing information
- Types of information
	- Physical cues
	- Salience (when something in our world stands out)
	- Facial expressions
	- Personality traits
	- Eye contact
	- Moral character
	- Nonverbal communication
- **Negativity effect**: negative aspects of a person's behavior stand out more even over equally extremely positive information
	- **Positivity bias**: despite this, we tend to evaluate people positively
	- **Halo effect**: using positive qualities to assume other positive qualities
- We assign people to **categories** based on information we gain about them, which each has their own **schemas**. Types:
	- Role schemas (roles or jobs of the people)
	- Person schemas (personality of the people)
	- Event schemas (what is to occur in certain situations)

### Attribution Theory

- **Attribution theory**: people are motivated to explain their own and other people's behavior by attributing causes of that behavior to either something in themselves or a trait that they have, called a **dispositional attribution**, or to something outside of the person called a **situational attribution**
- **Correspondent interference theory**: provides a way to determine if a person's behavior is due to dispositional or situational factors, involves examining the context in which the behavior occurs
	- First, understand if the person made the behavior of their own volition or if it was brought on by the situation
		- If the behavior was freely chosen, then it is evidence of the person's underlying traits
	- Second, consider the outcome produced by the person's behavior
		- If multiple outcomes, probably hard to discern the motive
		- If one motive, then it's easier to determine the motive
	- Third, examine whether the behavior was socially desirable or undesirable
		- If undesirable, then it's probably dispositional
		- If desirable, then we can't confidently determine the motive
	- Fourth, consider of a social role is at work
		- Determines if it is situational or dispositional
- **Covariation theory**: something can only be the cause of a behavior if it is present when the behavior occurs but absent when it doesn't occur
	- Distinctiveness asks whether the behavior is distinct or unique
	- Consensus asks whether there is agreement (whether others do this)
	- Consistency asks whether the behavior occurs at a regular rate or frequency
- Cognitive errors when explaining behavior
	- **Fundamental attribution error**: assigning a cause to another's behavior in which we automatically assume a dispositional reason for their actions and ignore situational factors
	- **Self-serving bias**: tendency to see ourselves in a favorable light
	- **Belief in a just world (BJW) hypothesis**: good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people
	- **Actor-observer bias**: when the actor overestimates the influence the influence of the situation on their own behavior while the observer overestimates the importance of the actor's personality traits on the actor's behavior

### What is an Attitude?

- **Attitude**: belief, feeling, or tendency that we hold regarding a person, a group of people, an idea, or an activity
	- Components: beliefs, feelings, and behaviors
	- Source: parents, media, etc.
	- Influence social thought
- **Cognitive dissonance theory**: when you have two contradictory thoughts at the same time
	- You can change your attitude
	- You can add a consonant thought
	- Change your behavior
	- Reduce the importance of dissonant cognitions
	- Focus on limited choices

### Attraction

- **Interpersonal attraction**: showing a preference for another person
- Factors affecting interpersonal attraction
	- Proximity
	- Attractive
	- Similar
	- Mutual exchange
	- Intimacy

### Social Influence

- **Social influence**: process by which others, whether individually or collectively, affect our perceptions, attitudes, and/or actions
- Types of social influence
	- **Conformity**: when we change our attitudes and/or behavior in order to go along with the crowd
		- **Normative social influence**: when we conform to the behavior of others to be accepted by them and to avoid the negative social consequences of acting deviant
		- **Informational social influence**: when we conform to the behavior of others because we view them as a source of knowledge about what we are supposed to do
	- **Compliance**: efforts to get a person to agree
		- More willing to comply with requests from friends
		- More willing to comply once we have committed to a position or action
			- **Foot-in-the-door**: make a small request first, then ask for something larger
		- We try to secure outcomes/objects that are scarce
		- More wiling to comply with a request from someone who previously provided a favor or concession to us
		- More willing to comply with a request if this action is consistent with what we believe people like us are doing
		- More willing to comply with requests from someone who holds power
	- **Obedience**: compliance with a command (ordering someone to do what they want)

### Helping Behavior

- **Prosocial behavior**: act we willingly take that is meant to help others
	- **Egotistical behavior**: focused on self
- **Altruistic behavior**: choose to help another person voluntarily without expecting a reward
- Why we help (dispositional factors)
	- Personal responsibility
	- Time pressure
	- Altruistic personality
	- Self-conscious emotions
	- Religion
	- Feeling good
	- Gender
	- Empathy
	- Egotistical reason (maximizing reward, minimize cost)
- Why we help (situational factors)
	- Bystander effect
	- Social norms and culture
