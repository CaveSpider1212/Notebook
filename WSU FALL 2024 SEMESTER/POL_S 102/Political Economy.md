description: The Economic Determinants of Democracy and Dictatorship & Theories of Political Economy
---

- **Political economy**: looking at the way political and economic processes interact and influence each other

### Key debates/ideas Political Economy

- Economic development affects political outcomes
- Classic Modernization theory
	- Societies pass through the same stages of economic development
	- Democracies are more likely to *emerge* as countries become more developed
- The "Survival Story"
	- Societies pass through the same stages of economic development
	- Democracies are more likely to *survive* as countries become more developed

### Classic Modernization Theory

- Economic development promotes democratization (helps them *emerge*)
	- The higher the GDP per capita in the country, the higher the proportion of democracies (in other words, countries with a higher income level are more likely to be democratic)
	- Transitions to democracy become more likely as income increases, and regime transitions may or may not become less likely as countries become richer
	- May not necessarily be true (just a theory)

### The "Survival Story"

- Economic development helps democracies *survive*, but it doesn't necessarily help them *emerge*
	- When economic development is low, the number of years under dictatorship is very high, and gets lower as the country gets more developed
	- When economic development is low, the number of years under democracy is low, but has an uneven pattern as economic development goes up until the country becomes very economically developed
		- In other words, countries that aren't super economically developed usually have a fluctuating number of years under democracy on the lower side
		- Transitions to democracy are unaffected by increases in income, and regime transitions become less likely as countries become richer

### Development, Regime Transition, and Democratization

- Transitions to dictatorship are more likely in low-income countries, while transitions to democracy are more likely in high-income countries

### Variants of Modernization Theory

- Classical Modernization Theory lacks a central causal mechanism
- Four variants
	- Structural changes
	- Natural resources
	- Foreign aid
	- Inequality

### Review

- Theories of political culture say:
	- There is a "congruence" between some features of culture and some features of politics.
	- Values, norms, beliefs, opinions, tastes, desires, symbols can be a cause of political outcomes.
- Theories of political institutions say:
	- Institutions are the "rules of the game" that are designed to coordinate behavior to achieve certain outcomes.
	- Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behavior and punish violations of these rules.

### Theories of Political Economy

- Behavior is the product of rational decision making to satisfy economic interests.
- Different types of ways of organizing the economy leads to different types of political organizations.
- Diverse interests produce political conflict because political institutions and policies have significant distributional consequences.
<hr>
- All members of society possess some endowment that has economic value
- All members of society are rational decision makers who have an interest in maximizing economic value
- Because different individuals have different endowments, each seeks to maximize their endowments, so they potentially come in conflict with each other
- Rational individuals recognize that control of policies/institutions is crucial to maximizing their endowment value

### Endowments

- **Endowments**: amount/value of the stuff that a person has under their control

### Rational Decision-Making

- **Rational decision-making**: procedure by which a decision is based, not the content or substance of the decision
	- Rational actor makes deliberate, intentional, and conscious choice between alternative, choosing the option that maximizes their status (maximizes their utility)
- Always prefer one or the other, or be utterly indifferent about choice
- We demand that if a third option considered next to the two, there must be a transitive relationship between the choices (having preferences of one of the others, like rankings)

### Conflict

- **Conflict**: there will be inevitable conflicts (uneven endowments) across people in economic life
	- For example, maybe real estate people would want to use a certain piece of land to build houses, but farmers may want it for agriculture

### Major Implication

> [!tip]
> Rational actors will care about who forms the government, what policies they pursue, and what institutions are in place because policies and institutions have distributive conflicts; they have influence over the returns we get on our endowments!

If benefits of complying with the rules are higher than the costs of changing the rules, most people will try to comply but maybe they will cheat.

If the benefits of complying are lower than the costs of changing them, actors may try to alter the institutions.

### What happens when political economy meets political institutions?

Acemoglu & Robinson
- Inclusive vs. Extractive Economic Institutions
	- **Inclusive**: pluralistic and centralized
		- Pluralistic: power is distributed broadly (minimize misuse of power)
		- Centralized: the state enforces law and order, provides public services, and regulates economic activities
	- **Extractive**: absolutist and decentralized
		- Absolutist: power is narrow and unconstrained
		- Decentralized: the central state has little control over law and order, public services, and economic regulation

### The Two Koreas

- North and South Korea experienced a bifurcated economic trajectory after the end of the Korean War
	- Crucially, both are initially managed by authoritarian governments
- South Korea recognizes private property rights and heavily invests in various firms and industries
	- They also invest in education, achieving high rates of literacy and schooling
- North Korea outlaws private property and a pluralistic market
	- Education is propaganda first and foremost if at all
- South Korea fully transitions to inclusive economic institutions in the 1980s
	- "By the 1970s, economic institutions in South Korea had become sufficiently inclusive that they reduced one of the strong rationales for extractive political institutions - the economic elite had little to gain from their own or the military's dominance of politics." (Acemoglu & Robinson)
	- "Equality of income in South Korea also meant that the elite had less to fear from pluralism and democracy." (Acemoglu & Robinson)

### Critiques of Political Economy Approaches

- Modernization theory still in dispute
	- Variants of the theory gaining more popularity
- Other contemporary examples, especially China with a stronger economy, but not necessarily democratic
- Class conflict? --> what about "culture wars," nationalistic populism
	- Political and economic institutions can mitigate conflict of interests
		- Like China, or even the USA with a highly unequal society (economically speaking), yet other issues motivate voters
